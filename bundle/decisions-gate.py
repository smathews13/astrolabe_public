"""Hold a release's resolved configuration against bundle/DECISIONS.md.

WHAT THIS IS FOR. On 2026-08-16 the instruction "remove all synthetic-data
framing" had been given three times and survived all three. One half of it was a
bundle variable, and its value was printed in the release script's own
configuration readout on every single run:

    data provenance       synthetic: every answer will disclose that its figures
                          are invented.

Nobody compared that line against the instruction, because the instruction lived
in a chat transcript and there was nothing to compare it against. It was noticed
scrolling past during a live model re-log, which is the most expensive moment
available, and it cost a release.

So the decisions are written down now, and this reads the configuration back
against them before anything irreversible happens.

THREE PROPERTIES THIS HAS TO KEEP, each learnt from a gate in this repo that lost
one and went quiet:

1. It runs BEFORE the model is logged and before the endpoint is touched.
   Catching it late is the whole cost being avoided. In agent-release.sh it sits
   immediately after the configuration readout, well before log_model.py; in
   app-release.sh it sits before the dry-run branch, so a dry run reports it too.

2. It is written against the MECHANISM, not against today's values. A rule that a
   variable must not resolve to "true" is SATISFIED when the variable does not
   exist, because a setting that is gone cannot turn anything on. That is what
   lets the synthetic rule keep passing once the variable is deleted, rather than
   becoming a check that has to be deleted along with it.

3. There is NO BYPASS FLAG, and one must not be added. Every other gate in these
   scripts has one, because every other gate asks a question about the world that
   can legitimately be answered "I know, proceed". This one asks what we decided.
   A decision that needs to change is changed in DECISIONS.md, deliberately, in a
   commit somebody can read.

WHAT IT CANNOT DO. Most of the decisions in DECISIONS.md are about copy and
layout, and no release configuration governs them. Those are PRINTED beside the
enforced ones and labelled as printed. A gate that showed them without saying
which half was which would imply a coverage it does not have, which is worse than
showing nothing.

Reads `databricks bundle validate -o json` on stdin. Exits 0 when nothing is
contradicted, 1 when something is, 2 when it could not run at all.
