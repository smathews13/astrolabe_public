"""Does the live Genie space differ from the one in this repository?

WHY A CONTENT CHECK AND NOT A VERSION TAG. `serialized_space` carries a
`version` field, and every instruction and sample question carries an `id`. It
is tempting to treat those as the thing that decides whether a deploy is needed,
because they are cheap to read and cheap to compare. They decide nothing. A
`version` that nobody bumped and an `id` that nobody changed sit happily above a
rewritten paragraph, so a change can be committed, deployed, reported as
successful, and never land -- and the tag agrees with the deploy rather than with
the workspace. That has already happened here once and cost a day.

So this compares the TEXT. It reads the body the bundle would push, out of
`databricks bundle validate -o json` with every `${var.*}` already resolved, and
the body the workspace is actually serving, out of the Genie API, and reports
what differs. A tag that was never bumped changes nothing about the answer.

WHAT COUNTS AS DRIFT, AND WHAT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT. Only the fields the bundle
DECLARES are compared. `space_id`, `etag`, `create_time` and `update_time` are
the server's and appear in no YAML, so they are not drift and are never reported
as such -- a check that flagged them would cry drift on every single run and
would be switched off within a week.

Within a declared field the comparison is EXACT, in both directions, because a
`bundle deploy` overwrites these bodies wholesale. A table that is live and not
committed is drift just as much as one that is committed and not live: the next
deploy deletes it, and somebody's analysts lose a table nobody meant to remove.
That direction is the one a "did my change land?" check forgets, and it is the
more dangerous of the two.

WHAT THIS CANNOT TELL YOU. That an instruction which landed is being FOLLOWED.
The two look identical from here, and the only way to tell them apart is to ask
the space a question that depends on the change. It also says nothing about
permissions or about whether the curated tables are inside the model's declared
scopes; that is `bundle/genie-live-check.py`, which is a different question and
is kept separate rather than folded in.

READS ONLY. It makes no change to any workspace object and takes no lock, so it
is safe to run against a live deployment, including one somebody is mid-deploy
on or demonstrating.

Exit status is the point of the whole file:
  0  every space checked is in sync; a deploy would change nothing
  1  at least one space has drifted; the committed content is not what is live
  2  at least one space could not be read, so nothing is established either way

# the semantic layer: the same question, asked of the indexed definitions
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Arch#7. `agent/semantic_layer_build.py` builds the indexed entries FROM Unity
# Catalog's own words -- the table comment and the column comments. That makes the
# entries a DERIVED artifact, and a derived artifact has the failure mode this whole
# file exists for: the source changes, the derivation is never re-run, and nothing
# says so. Any governed-metadata change that rewrites a column comment is exactly
# that change, and the index goes on serving the old wording until somebody rebuilds
# it.
#
# WHY THAT IS WORSE HERE THAN FOR A GENIE SPACE. A stale space instruction produces
# a worse answer. A stale semantic entry produces a CONFIDENT WRONG DEFINITION: the
# agent quotes the indexed text as the governed meaning of a column, so a reader is
# told a definition that Unity Catalog no longer holds, in the voice of the thing
# that is supposed to be authoritative.
#
# AND WHY IT IS COMPARED BY TEXT, not by `generated_at` or a digest column. The
# entries carry both. Either would be cheaper to read and neither decides anything:
# a `generated_at` from this morning sits happily above wording from last month if
# the rebuild read a cached description, and a digest only agrees with itself. So
# this asks whether the words Unity Catalog holds NOW are the words the index is
# serving, which is the only comparison whose answer means what it appears to mean.
