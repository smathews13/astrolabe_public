"""Admission control: what may influence an answer, and what may only be reported.

ONE GATE IN FRONT OF EVERY DATA-PRODUCING TOOL. Direct SQL has been well governed
for a while: a parse, the baked manifest, the protected-column policy, and the
warehouse's own result schema. Genie was not held to the same standard, and the
gap was not a missing check so much as a missing DECISION: an unparseable
generated statement, or a chart with no statement behind it, arrived with a caveat
attached and went on to become figures, sources and prose. A caveat is not a
control. A reader who is told the sources are incomplete still reads the number.

So the shape here is deliberate. A tool produces a CANDIDATE, the gateway returns
a VERDICT, and only an accepted verdict may reach synthesis. Everything else is
reported: as a governance refusal, as an access denial, or as an operational
failure, which are three different facts and have never been allowed to collapse
into one here.

WHY THE VERDICT CARRIES THE ORIGINAL REFUSAL. `Verdict.refusal` is the exact
`SqlRefused` the guard raised, and the SQL path re-raises that object rather than
a new one built from the verdict. The messages are long, specific, and load-bearing
(one of them deliberately says COUNT rather than "aggregate", because recommending
an aggregate hands back the bypass), and a gateway that rewrote them would be a
second set of words for the same policy. Re-raising the object is also what makes
the refactor provable: the existing suite asserts on those messages and cannot
tell that a gateway is now in the path.

WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT DECIDE. It does not fetch, execute, or retry anything,
and it holds no client. It is given what a tool found and answers one question
about it. That is what lets the same object serve SQL, both Genie spaces, and
whatever surface is added next, and it is why it can be tested without a
workspace.

#: the loop immediately said "do not ask another tool the same question, and do not
#: rephrase it as prose for a Genie space". A model reading both does either thing
#: at random, which is a poor way to run a control whose whole cost is one extra
#: turn.
#:
#: The difference is real rather than a wording preference. A protected column is a
#: restriction on what the answer may contain, so every route to it is closed. An
#: unattributable result is a restriction on what may be used as PROOF, and the same
#: question asked for a table comes back with a query attachment the guard can
#: parse. So the remedy is a re-ask, on the same space, and it is worth naming

    "columns or the grouping you want, rather than as a chart or a summary. A table comes "
    "back with the query behind it, which can be attributed, and an attributed result can "
    "be charted afterwards. Prefer that re-ask to giving up, and prefer it to switching to "
    "another tool. Two things you must not do: do not restate any figure from the refused "
    "attempt, because it was not admitted as evidence and repeating it puts an unverifiable "
    "number in the answer anyway; and if the re-ask is also refused, say the figures could "
    "not be attributed rather than reporting them with a warning."

#: What the loop tells the model when the refusal itself names a remedy.
#:
#: THE SAME DEFECT AS THE PAIR ABOVE, one control further along, and it cost a
#: stakeholder a whole answer. Asked for week-over-week retention, the run was
#: refused with "COUNT them instead: count(DISTINCT platformid_accountid) is
#: allowed", and then handed `_RESTRICTION_GUIDANCE`, which says not to re-ask.
#: The model was told to count and told not to try again in the same message; it
#: re-sent a near-identical query, was refused identically, and reported that
#: retention could not be produced.
#:
#: The distinction is not strictness, it is what the refusal is ABOUT. A
#: cross-label bridge is a restriction on the ANSWER, so every route to it is
#: closed. A statement refused for the shape it is written in is a restriction on
#: the STATEMENT, and the same question asked with the identifier one level lower
#: is a different statement, not the same request wearing a hat.
#:
#: BOUNDED AT ONE, and the bound is the second half of the fix rather than

        nowhere and the user watched a step fail on every run that hit it.

        The guard was right about what it saw and wrong about what it was for.
        Attribution is a rule about NUMBERS: a figure a reader cannot trace to a
        table is a figure they cannot check, and that has not moved. A definition
        is not a figure. It is the governed MEANING of a field, it is text, and

        defines it — which no query can attribute, because the absence of a row
        is what is being reported.

        So this route is judged on whether a definition came back, and the value
        of attribution is kept where it exists rather than required: a lookup that
        did read the dictionary table cites it. What does NOT change is the column
        policy, which `_genie_assets` applies to both routes and which raises: a
        statement that would hand back an address is refused whatever the question
        was, and no payload type makes that acceptable.

        `PAYLOAD_DEFINITION` either way, so `may_support_a_figure` is False even
