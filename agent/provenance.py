"""What an answer's figures are figures OF, read off the statements that ran.

Four facts, per statement: the table it read, what it measured, the time range it
covered, and which rows it kept. An answer already says which tables it read and
carries the SQL, and neither closes the gap this module exists for: "8,413 active
players" is a different claim depending on whether the window was thirty days or
a year, and on whether one title was filtered out. A reader who has to open the
SQL to find out is a reader who does not find out.

DERIVED FROM THE PARSE, NEVER FROM THE MODEL'S PROSE. The synthesiser could be
asked to state its window and filter, and it would: fluently, and from whatever
it remembered of a result set rather than from the query. That is the failure this
codebase has already had in every other place a claim about a run was left to the
model. Every field below comes from `sqlglot`'s tree for the exact string that was
executed, which is the same parse the SQL guard admits the statement on.

IT FAILS CLOSED, AND SILENCE IS THE FAILURE MODE. A statement that will not parse
contributes nothing; a table that cannot be resolved leaves the source empty; a
window nothing in the WHERE clause describes stays empty. Empty renders as
nothing at all in the app rather than as "unknown" or as a guess. The reason is
that a wrong window is worse than no window: it is a specific, checkable claim
about the population behind a number, and a reader has no way to tell a derived
one from an invented one.

NO VALUE OF AN IDENTIFYING COLUMN IS PUBLISHED. A filter is the one field here
built from literals a question can put there, so `player_id = 'abc'` would carry
a player's key into an answer, a Lakebase row and a trace -- the three places the
column policy exists to keep it out of. The column is named and the value is
withheld, so the reader still learns that the population was narrowed to one
player without being handed which. Column NAMES are published: `count(DISTINCT
platformid_accountid)` is the product working, and a name is not a person.
