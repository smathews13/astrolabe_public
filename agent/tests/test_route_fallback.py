"""The Genie-to-SQL fallback, at the loop level, proven gone.

`test_route_disclosure.py` tests the ledger in isolation. This file is the part
that matters to a reader of an answer: a run where a Genie space fails and the
model then reaches for the warehouse, checked end to end for the two things that
were missing before. The model is no longer invited to reroute, and when it
reroutes anyway the answer says so.

Written against the same scenario the outage audit used, because that run is the
one the old behaviour looked best on: every figure in it was real and governed,
which is why a substitution that changed what the figures MEANT went unnoticed
for so long.
