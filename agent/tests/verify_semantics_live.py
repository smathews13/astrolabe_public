"""Proves the live semantic index withholds what the caller is not scoped to.

Not a unit test, and deliberately not named ``test_*`` so pytest does not collect
it: it writes to a real table, syncs a real index and needs a real token.

    uv run python tests/verify_semantics_live.py \
        --catalog <your_catalog> --schema <your_schema> \
        --warehouse-id <id>

WHY PROBES RATHER THAN THE REAL CORPUS. The demo catalog grants `account users`
ALL_PRIVILEGES, so every real entry in this estate carries the public token and
every caller matches it. A check that queried the built corpus and found results
would pass just as happily with the scope filter deleted, which is the only
state worth detecting. `verify_identity_live.py` needs a probe table for exactly
this reason and says so; this is the same problem one layer up.

WHAT THE PROBES ARE, and why the raw query is the control. Three rows are
written to the source table, indexed, and then asked for twice:

  UNSCOPED   scoped to a user nobody signs in as. In the index, matched by the
             query, and must not come back.
  MINE       scoped to the caller's own address. Must come back, or the filter
             is not filtering, it is refusing everything.
  OUTSIDE    scoped to everybody, describing an asset outside the declared
             manifest. Must not come back, and this is the gate that does not
             depend on grants at all.

Asking the INDEX directly is what makes the result mean something. It shows the
withheld rows are present, embedded and returned by the same query, so the only
thing standing between them and the caller is the tool. Without that control a
pass is indistinguishable from an index that had nothing in it.

WHAT THIS CANNOT TELL YOU:

  1. It does not prove Unity Catalog would stop a caller who lacks SELECT on the
     index. This runs as one person, and the index is a UC securable whose
     enforcement belongs to UC. What it proves is the layer above: that the tool
     withholds entries the caller's scope does not name, which is the part that
     is ours to get wrong.
  2. `authorized_scope` is a snapshot taken when the build ran. Nothing here
     measures how stale it is; the rebuild schedule is what bounds that.
