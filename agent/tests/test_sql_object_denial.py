"""A table the executing identity was not granted, and what the reader is told.

THE FIXTURE IN THIS FILE IS A REAL MEASUREMENT, not a plausible sentence. It was
produced on 2026-08-10 against the example workspace by a purpose-built identity
probe: the app's own service principal read a table it holds no grant on, through a SQL
warehouse, and the warehouse answered with `OBSERVED_DENIAL` below and
`sql_state: 42501` as a separate field on the status.

That matters because the redaction this file pins was originally written against
an ASSUMED message. Nobody had a workspace where a denial actually happened, since
every identity in the demo estate can read everything, which is the condition the
probe was built to break. A test carrying the assumption cannot fail on the day
the assumption is wrong, so this one carries the measurement instead.

WHAT IS PINNED, in the order the failure used to travel:

  1. `statement_failure` does not repeat the warehouse's words. The message names
     `pia_identity_probe` and `canary_rows`, and both callers of that function put
     their string somewhere a reader reaches: the direct path raises it into a
     trace stage, the Genie path folds it into a tool result. A trace stage is
     rendered in the browser (`client/src/TraceTimeline.tsx` prints `stage.output`
     verbatim), so this is the difference between an operator log and a leak.
  2. A denial is CLASSIFIED as one. It used to reach the generic handler and be
     disclosed as a surface that "did not respond", which sends the reader to wait
     out an outage that is not one, and tells the model the data "may well be
     readable another way".
  3. `42501` and `42P01` stay apart. Telling somebody they lack access to a table
     that is simply not there sends them to ask for a grant nobody can make; the
     reverse confirms that an object they may not read exists.

DO NOT WIDEN THE CLASSIFIER TO "does not have". That phrase is in the fixture and
is deliberately not what any of this keys on: it appears in failures about
entirely unrelated objects, and a false positive tells a reader they were denied
when something else broke. The probe that produced the fixture was narrowed away
from the same trap on the same day. `test_the_trap_phrase_alone_is_not_a_denial`
holds it.
