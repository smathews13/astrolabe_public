"""The gate that decides whether a question runs at all.

The property under test is negative and easy to lose: no request that cannot be
attributed to the person asking it reaches a Genie space, a warehouse, or an
orchestrator call. Every assertion about what a refused turn RETURNS is secondary
to the assertions about what it did not DO, because a refusal that has already
read three tables has not refused anything.

NOT COVERED, because it needs a logged version on a real endpoint: whether Model
Serving actually parks a downscoped invoker token, and whether the account name
`current_user.me()` reports for a forwarded user token is the same string the app
resolves from `x-forwarded-email`. Those are asserted against a deployment, and
this file asserts what the agent does with the answer.
