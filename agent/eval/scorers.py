"""The evaluation scorer set, as MLflow `@scorer` functions.

ONE DEFINITION, THREE ENVIRONMENTS. These objects are what a development run
scores with, what the pre-release run scores with, and what production
monitoring registers. There is no second implementation per environment, and
there should not be one: a scorer that means something slightly different in
production than it did in development produces a regression signal nobody can
act on, because the first question is always whether the agent changed or the
scorer did.

NOTHING HERE GATES ANYTHING. These functions return numbers. No caller in this
repository blocks a release, a deployment or a certification on one, and that is
a recorded scope decision (unified plan, X3) rather than an unfinished edge.

TWO RULES ABOUT WHAT A SCORER MAY SAY.

Rationales are structural. They name fields, counts and column names -- never
the question, never a sentence of the answer, never a value from a row. An
evaluation record is an operational record, it is read and stored and shipped
around like one, and it must not become the way somebody reconstructs what a
customer asked or which player a figure was about. The cheapest way to hold that
line is for the rationale to have nothing else available to it.

Scorers abstain rather than guess. Every one of them can return
`not-applicable`, and several routinely do: a definitional answer has no SQL, a
refusal has no sources, a case with no labelled entity has no recall to measure.
An abstention is excluded from both halves of a rate. The alternative -- scoring
an inapplicable case as a failure -- is what makes a correct refusal look like a
defect, and scoring it as a pass is what makes a rate meaningless.

WHY THE IMPORTS ARE INSIDE THE FUNCTIONS. MLflow serialises a scorer to register
it for production monitoring, and a module-level import of anything outside the
standard library does not survive that. The agent's own modules (`sql_policy`)
are imported inside the function body for the same reason, and they resolve in
the serving image because they are logged with the model.
