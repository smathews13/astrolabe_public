"""Build the semantic-layer source table from what the deployment already knows.

FOUR SOURCES, IN ORDER OF HOW MUCH ANYONE HAS REVIEWED THEM.

  Unity Catalog. One entry per declared table, from the table's own COMMENT and
  its columns' comments. This is the customer's sentence about the customer's
  table, so it is right on any estate, and it is the only description of a schema
  this repo is willing to carry: nothing here asserts what anyone's table is for.

  The Genie spaces. What each space curates, as a data product, plus whatever
  example questions the space records. A space's curation is a statement that
  somebody expects these tables to answer questions together, which is exactly
  the discovery signal a manifest cannot express.

  The deployment's data dictionary, if the manifest declares it. A term per
  documented COLUMN, which is the only column-level meaning this layer has where
  Unity Catalog's column comments are empty — as they are on every table here.

  A curated file, supplied by the deployment. Metrics, terms and approved joins.
  THE ONLY SOURCE ALLOWED TO CLAIM CERTIFICATION, because certification is a
  review somebody performed and the other three have been through none.

THE ASSET LIST IS THE DECLARED MANIFEST, never a live Unity Catalog listing.
Indexing semantics for a table outside the manifest would let the agent discover
something it has no grant to read and offer it to a stakeholder, and the failure
would arrive at the warehouse one turn later.

`authorized_scope` IS A CACHED PROJECTION OF UNITY CATALOG GRANTS, taken here and
already stale by the time anyone queries it. It narrows what discovery reveals.
It does not decide what can be read: the caller's own grants do that, at the
warehouse, on every read the agent performs. A grantee this build cannot map to
a token the caller will present, such as a service principal's application id,
produces no token and therefore no match, which is the direction to fail in.

NOTHING HERE DEPLOYS. `--dry-run` is the default and prints what would be
written. `--apply` runs the statements against the configured warehouse.
