/**
 * The mark is the delivered drawing, not a redrawing of it.
 *
 * `astrolabe-rebuild-spec.md` §1 and `assets/logo/README.md` both say "never
 * redraw, never restroke", and that instruction is worth nothing unless
 * something reads the delivered files. So this reads all four of them off disk
 * and compares every coordinate, radius, stroke width and dash pattern against
 * `astrolabe-mark.ts`. A well-meant rounding of 21.5 to 22, or a rim taken from
 * a screenshot rather than from the file, fails here.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT COMPARED IS COLOUR AND OPACITY. The delivered pairs
 * differ in both -- `astrolabe-rete.svg` sets its web lines at 0.5 and
 * `-white.svg` at 0.45, because a hairline needs a little more presence on navy
 * -- and the whole reason the geometry lives in TypeScript is that the app needs
 * inks the two files do not carry (see the header of astrolabe-mark.ts). Colour
 * is the stylesheet's, and opacity is a property of the seating. Geometry is the
 * part that may not move, and geometry is what this file holds.
