/**
 * What a reader actually sees on Ops, asserted against rendered markup.
 *
 * Rendered rather than inspected, in the pattern `connections-render.test.tsx`
 * established and `monitoring-render.test.tsx` follows: this repository has been
 * bitten by screens that were wrong while every assertion about their source was
 * true. The three bodies take a state rather than fetching into one, so every
 * state can be driven here without a browser, which is just as well because this
 * repository is not allowed to run one.
 *
 * THE PROPERTY MOST OF THIS FILE IS ABOUT is that the three blocks are
 * independent. It is the design's central claim and the one that is quietly lost
 * first, because a refactor that merges three fetches into one looks like a
 * tidy-up and reads like an improvement. Health is a live probe, cost is a
 * workspace-wide billing query and traffic is a query against the app's own
 * store; behind one route, the slowest and least readable of the three decides
 * when the other two appear.
 *
 * PIXELS ARE NOT VERIFIED BY ANY OF THIS. These tests read the words a person
 * would read. Nothing here says the layout is right.
