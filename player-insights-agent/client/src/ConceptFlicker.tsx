/**
 * The loader: four mark concepts flickering through one stacked slot (`#17a`).
 *
 * The rete, the reticle, the horizon and the d-pad each fade in, hold and fade
 * out on a 3.2s cycle at 0.8s intervals, so the slot is always showing exactly
 * one of them. The d-pad is the app's identity mark and the other three are the
 * concepts it was chosen from; the loader is the only place they are ever seen.
 *
 * THE STATIC MARK NEVER FLICKERS. A header lockup that cycled through four
 * drawings would make the app's identity a thing in motion, which is the
 * opposite of what an identity is for. This is a working state and nothing else.
 *
 * Decorative: every mark is `aria-hidden` and the seating supplies the one
 * `aria-live` string (§5). Under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` the guard in
 * astrolabe-animation.css hides all four but the one carrying `data-ast-rest`,
 * which is the d-pad -- a reader who asked for no motion should be looking at
 * the app's mark rather than at an archive concept.
