/**
 * What a recorded result is read as, and what it refuses to read.
 *
 * The payloads here are the ones the agent really writes. The Genie strings are
 * `_genie` in agent/tools.py joining `format_genie_space`, the interpretation
 * attachment, `render_rows` and Genie's prose; the semantic strings are
 * `RetrievalOutcome.rendered` in agent/semantic_retrieval.py, whose heading is
 * `[{entry_kind}] {name} ({tags})` and whose columns are one per line. A parse
 * asserted against a payload invented here would pass while the panel showed a
 * paragraph.
 *
 * EVERY PARSE HAS A REFUSAL TEST, and those are the ones that matter most. The
 * reading is only safe to attempt because a shape it cannot find returns null and
 * the caller falls back to markdown, so a parse that started guessing instead of
 * refusing would be a silent regression: the panel would show a card that says
 * something the payload does not.
