 * a conversation, and turning something on for yourself must never change what a
 * customer's deployment offers anybody else. That is why it is localStorage
 * rather than `/api/settings`, which is the store for what the deployment IS.
 *
 * One key per flag, and a flag is on only when its value is exactly "true".
 * Same fail-closed rule the server applies to
 * `PLAYER_INSIGHTS_SHARED_CONVERSATION_RAIL`, for the same reason: unset, empty,
 * "1", "yes", stale JSON from an earlier shape of this file and a typo all have to
 * land on off, because every one of them means "nobody deliberately asked for
 * this". A key per flag rather than one JSON blob so that adding the next
 * experiment cannot corrupt or drop this one, and so junk in one key is not junk
 * in all of them.
 *
 * Reading is routed through here, once, rather than at each surface that cares.
 * Three surfaces used to be able to disagree about whether the Benchmark Lab
 * exists, and a nav bar that offers a page the page next to it hides is worse
 * than either answer on its own.
