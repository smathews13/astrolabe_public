/**
 * The two reads Ask PIA makes when it opens: the conversation list the rail is
 * built from, and the run list the rail's status pills come from.
 *
 * ONE EFFECT, TWO REQUESTS, BOTH IN FLIGHT AT ONCE. They used to be two separate
 * `useEffect`s in the page, which is not the same thing even though it looks it:
 * two effects run back-to-back so the requests did overlap, but nothing in the
 * page said they had to, and the arrangement is one edit away from becoming a
 * waterfall -- add an `await` to the first, or make the second depend on
 * something the first sets, and the rail suddenly loads in two round trips
 * instead of one. Stating the concurrency here makes it a property of the code
 * rather than an accident of effect ordering.
 *
 * WHY IT IS A MODULE. This suite has no jsdom, so a fetch written inside an
 * effect is unobservable: effects never run. "Each route is asked for exactly
 * once per load" is then the kind of claim that fails silently -- a duplicate
 * request breaks nothing visible, it just doubles the cost of opening the page,
 * so nobody finds out. Here it is a function a test can call with a stubbed
 * `fetch` and count.
 *
 * NEITHER FAILURE IS FATAL, AND THEY FAIL DIFFERENTLY. A rail with no status
 * pills is a rail; a rail with no conversations is an outage the reader has to
 * be told about. So the runs read fails silently to an empty map, and the
 * conversations read reports itself as unavailable. That difference is why this
 * returns one record describing both outcomes rather than throwing.
