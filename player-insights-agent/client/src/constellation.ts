/**
 * The constellations, as coordinates.
 *
 * `loading-suite.md` and the design reference give three of them -- the splash's
 * five hops (`#5ar`), the working strip's three (`#5br`) and the opening
 * sequence's five separate patterns (`#19a`) -- and every number here is
 * transcribed from that reference rather than composed. They are drawings, and
 * a constellation with its hops re-spaced by eye is a different drawing.
 *
 * WHY DATA RATHER THAN JSX. Three reasons, and the third is the one that pays:
 *
 *   1. The stagger is arithmetic on the hop's position in its chain, and a
 *      stagger typed per element is a stagger that goes wrong on the day a hop
 *      is inserted.
 *   2. Three surfaces draw these and one renderer serves all three, so a star
 *      pops the same way in the splash, the working strip and the opening.
 *   3. A test can read it. `constellation.test.ts` checks that every hop lands on
 *      a star, that no star is unreachable, and that nothing is drawn outside the
 *      panel it is drawn in -- none of which is visible in JSX and all of which
 *      is the kind of thing that ships.
 *
 * COLOUR IS NOT HERE. Each star names an `ink` or an `accent`, resolved by
 * astrolabe-loaders.css, for the same reason the mark's geometry names them: a
 * hex in a component is a colour no palette check can reach.
