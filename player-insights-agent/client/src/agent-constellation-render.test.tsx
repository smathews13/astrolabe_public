/**
 * What the two constellation bands are to a reader who is not looking at them.
 *
 * The geometry is checked next door, in `agent-constellation.test.ts`, and that
 * file is about a box nothing can leave. This one is about the other half of §5:
 * everything decorative is `aria-hidden`, there is ONE `aria-live="polite"` status
 * string, and `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` freezes all of it.
 *
 * The reason those are tests rather than review notes is that they are invisible
 * on the surface they govern. A band that is animating for a reader who asked the
 * operating system for no animation looks completely correct to everybody else,
 * and so does a drawing that has quietly become a second set of tab stops.
 *
 * A rule in a stylesheet cannot see whether its element carries `aria-hidden`, so
 * the split is: astrolabe-animation.css owns the guard and is tested for it there,
 * and the claims that are about the MARKUP are here.
