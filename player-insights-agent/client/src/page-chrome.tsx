/**
 * The reasoning behind a stated fact, collapsed.
 *
 * Every surface in this app had the same failure: a nuanced state was reported
 * by narrating three sentences of reasoning where a chip and a short line would
 * do. The reasoning is usually correct and worth keeping, so it moves in here
 * rather than being deleted -- one reader in twenty wants it and the other
 * nineteen were reading past it to find the status.
 *
 * `<details>` rather than AppKit's Collapsible, on purpose. Collapsible unmounts
 * its content while shut, so a distinction one of the standing decisions
 * protects would stop being in the document at all, and the tests that hold
 * those decisions read the rendered text. A closed `<details>` is present and
 * addressable and simply not drawn, which is what "behind a disclosure" should
 * mean.
 *
 * `summary` is a label, not a question. The house style kills phrases in
 * headings, and a summary is a heading for the thing under it.
