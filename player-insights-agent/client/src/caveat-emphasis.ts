/**
 * What is set apart inside a caveat: the table it is about, and its numbers.
 *
 * The Keep in mind section is a block of amber prose, and the reported problem
 * with it was that everything in it weighs the same. A reader looking for which
 * table a warning is about, or for how big "understated" turned out to be, had
 * to read every bullet to the end. So a caveat that names exactly one of the
 * answer's own tables leads with that table's short name as a tag, and the
 * counts, percentages and thresholds inside the sentence are drawn bold.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE REWRITES A CAVEAT. `emphasiseFigures` cuts the string into runs
 * that concatenate back to it exactly, so a disclosure cannot be reworded,
 * truncated or reordered on its way to the screen -- the property
 * caveat-list.test.ts has guarded since the caveats were one joined paragraph,
 * now guarded here as a round trip rather than as the absence of a `.replace`.

 *   - A bare year. "the 2026 season" is a date written as one number, and there
 *     is nothing in the string to distinguish it from a count, so the range is
 *     the distinguisher. A year with a thousands separator, a decimal or a
