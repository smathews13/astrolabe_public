/**
 * The published held-out evaluation scorecard.
 *
 * WHERE THE FILE BESIDE THIS ONE COMES FROM. `scripts/run-held-out-eval.ts`
 * writes `eval-scorecard.generated.json` by running the twelve labelled cases
 * through `startBenchmarkRun` -- the Benchmark Lab's own runner, unmodified --
 * with the operator's OAuth token forwarded to the serving endpoint. It is
 * committed rather than fetched, so the pane can state the date, the commit and
 * the model version the figures were produced against.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NOT PRODUCED BY THE OFFLINE HARNESS, which is what this module used
 * to say was coming. `agent/eval/run_eval.py` reaches the agent in-process with
 * no forwarded user token. The agent reads governed data as the person who
 * asked and has no service-principal fallback -- three of them were deliberately
 * closed -- so every turn of an offline run is refused at the identity gate
 * before a tool is built. That is the governance property working, and the fix
 * was emphatically not to give the harness a way through: it was to run the
 * evaluation on the one path that has a caller.
 *
 * THE GUARD THAT MATTERS IS IN THE WRITER, NOT HERE. The script refuses to write
 * a scorecard when every case ended at the identity gate, so a file that exists
 * is a file whose cases actually ran. This module's job is only to say which of
 * the two states the app is in.
