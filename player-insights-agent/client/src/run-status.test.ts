 * The rest of this suite asserts against source and stylesheet, which is right
 * for a claim about a default or a rule that exists. It is not enough here. Every
 * claim below is about what a reader is looking at in a particular state -- that
 * an unreachable endpoint does not produce a green pill, that a finished run does
 * not go on breathing -- and each is one wrong ternary away from being false while
 * a source-level test of the same file passes. So the component is rendered to
 * markup, in the node environment the suite already runs in, with no DOM and no
 * new dependency: `react-dom/server` is what `react-dom` ships for this.
 *
 * What this cannot see is the paint: whether the animation actually runs, what
 * the cadence looks like, what a screen reader says. No browser was launched.
