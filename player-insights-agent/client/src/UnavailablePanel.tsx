/**
 * The one way this app renders "we could not find out".
 *
 * One component rather than a convention, because a convention is what the app
 * had: every pane wrote its own red alert at the point it gave up, and they
 * disagreed on whether to name a remedy, whether to offer a retry, and whether
 * to say that the space below was blank rather than zero. Two of them offered a
 * reference row to fill the space, which is the behaviour this whole change
 * exists to delete.
 *
 * All of the wording is decided in `unavailable-copy.ts` and none of it here, so
 * the decision can be tested without a browser. This file is layout and ARIA.
