/**
 * The held-out evaluation pane, and the claims it is not allowed to make.
 *
 * This suite runs in node with no DOM, so nothing below clicks anything. What
 * it does instead is render the section to static markup against real scorecard
 * shapes and assert what the reader ends up looking at -- which is the whole of
 * what this component does, since it holds no state and fires no effect.
 *
 * The tests that matter most are not about layout. A scorecard is the screen in
 * this app that most looks like evidence, so the failures worth pinning are the
 * ones where it says something true-looking and wrong: a scorer that cannot
 * report rendering as a pass, a rate rendering without the population it is
 * over, a latency rendering as though it were a quality score, or the
 * non-gating notice quietly disappearing so that a low number starts being
 * treated as a release gate.
