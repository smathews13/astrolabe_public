/**
 * What an unavailable surface says, decided apart from how it is drawn.
 *
 * Every page that can fail used to write its own sentence at the point it gave
 * up, so one Lakebase outage read as four unrelated problems: "Stored benchmark
 * runs could not be read", a red badge saying "Representative runs", a rail that
 * silently showed nothing, and a trace pane offering a reference run. A reader
 * seeing two of those at once cannot tell whether they have one fault or two.
 *
 * The wording lives here rather than in the components for the same reason
 * `storage-banner-copy.ts` exists: which sentence is correct is a decision worth
 * testing, and a decision buried in a render is not testable without a browser.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED, AND WHY THE PREVIOUS VERSION WAS WORSE THAN NOTHING. This module
 * used to build one paragraph by concatenating three sentences: the taxonomy's
 * generic message, a sentence about what a blank pane does not mean, and advice
 * on whether to wait. On the Ask surface that produced four lines about the
 * app's posture and not one word about the failure -- while the response body it
 * was built from carried the endpoint's status, the provider's error code and
 * the provider's own sentence in `detail`, which this module had nowhere to put
 * and therefore dropped. A reader was told "a service this needed did not
 * respond just now" over a payload that said `403 PERMISSION_DENIED`. Copy that
 * withholds the error while reassuring the reader about our principles is worse
 * than a raw stack trace, because the stack trace can at least be searched.
 *
 * SO THE ORDER IS NOW: what failed, what it said, where it stopped, who it ran
 * as, and one sentence of consequence. Each is a separate field, because a
 * concatenated paragraph is how the error got lost the first time -- there was
 * no field whose absence a test could notice.
 *
 * AND THE ONE THING IT MUST NEVER SAY: that the numbers are elsewhere on screen.
 * A failure sentence offering "showing recent results below" is the fabrication
 * with an apology attached.
