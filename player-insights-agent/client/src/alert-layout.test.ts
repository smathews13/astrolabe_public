/**
 * An AlertDescription is laid out by the library again, and the app no longer argues.
 *
 * This file used to assert the opposite. The stylesheet pinned
 * `[data-slot='alert-description']` to `display: block`, because AppKit ships the slot
 * as `grid justify-items-start gap-1`, which puts every direct child on a row of its
 * own and so turned a sentence with an inline <strong> in it into a list. The pin
 * worked, and it cost more than it saved: it is unlayered, Tailwind's utilities are
 * not, so it outranked them, and a `flex flex-col gap-1.5` written at a call site was
 * silently ignored. Flex children have no whitespace between them, because JSX drops
 * it, so the spacing that class was asking for was the only thing separating one
 * sentence from the next -- the storage banner shipped reading "Nothing stored
 * yet.Lakebase is connected", and the shared unavailable panel collapsed a heading, a
 * detail line, a timestamp and a retry button onto one unbroken line. Both looked like
 * a rendering fault, both were live in front of a customer, and both were one inert
 * class. The handoff records the pin as the defect behind them, and it is gone.
 *
 * Note that layering it rather than deleting it would have been the same thing as
 * deleting it. AppKit applies `grid` to the element as a utility class, so any rule of
 * ours inside a layer loses to it. There was no half measure available here.
 *
 * What that hands back is the row-per-child behaviour, which is right for the call
 * sites that stack a heading over a detail and wrong for the ones that write a
 * sentence across a <strong> and the text after it. Those read as one paragraph today
 * and will read as two rows now. The answer is to wrap the sentence in one child,
 * which is what UnavailablePanel already does; it is call-site work in .tsx and is
 * recorded in the handover rather than done here.
 *
 * So this file asserts what is now true: that the app does not pin the slot's layout
 * from anywhere, and that the two rules which are about the alert running off the
 * right edge -- the half of the original complaint that had nothing to do with
 * display -- are still there. Those two are the invariant worth keeping.
