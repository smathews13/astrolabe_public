/**

 * Unity Catalog for the grants Monitoring and Ops read. The second can be refused
 * while the first succeeds, and every test here is a way that fact could be
 * smoothed over on screen. Each of the smoothings looks tidier than the truth,
 * which is why they need a test rather than a comment:
 *
 *   - Drawing an unanswered row as "no access". It is "not checked".
 *   - Drawing a refusal as pending, so it reads as something that will resolve.
 *   - Drawing access the person already had as access this app granted, which
 *     decides whether it is taken away when they are removed.
 *   - Reporting the add as done when only the role landed.
 *
 * The visible claims are asserted against RENDERED markup, in the pattern
 * connections-render.test.tsx set: this repository has shipped screens that were
 * wrong while every assertion about their source was true.
