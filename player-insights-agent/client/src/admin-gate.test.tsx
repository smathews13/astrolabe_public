/**
 * That a consumer who follows an administrator's link is told so, rather than
 * being handed an admin page that refuses every request it makes.
 *
 * THIS FILE EXISTS FOR THE THIRD INSTANCE OF ONE DEFECT. role.ts has held the
 * gate's heading, its per-page line, its action and the role-loss sentence since
 * the permission work landed, with tests over every one of them, and nothing in
 * the app called any of it. The role badge was the first instance and the
 * navigation row was the second; both were caught by a test that rendered the
 * thing rather than the module behind it, and both notes say so at the top of
 * their files.
 *
 * So every assertion below renders a ROUTE. A test of `gateLine` cannot fail
 * when no component calls it. These can.
 *
 * PIXELS ARE NOT VERIFIED BY ANY OF THIS. It is markup, wording and route
 * outcomes. Nothing here says the panel is centred or that it fits.
