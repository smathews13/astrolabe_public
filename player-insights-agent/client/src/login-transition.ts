/**
 * The transition out of the login gate and into Ask, as timing and one predicate.
 *
 * Built to `login-transition.md`. Apart from the components for the reason
 * `opening-sequence.ts` is apart from `OpeningSequence.tsx`: this suite has no DOM
 * and no browser, so a phase window expressed as a function is something a test
 * can read and a phase window expressed inline in JSX is not.
 *
 * THE KEYFRAMES ARE NOT IN THE DESIGN REFERENCE, and that is worth stating rather
 * than quietly working around. The spec says to copy `ast-x-click`, `ast-x-card`,
 * `ast-x-star`, `ast-x-sky`, `ast-x-app`, `ast-x-mark` and `ast-x-bar` verbatim
 * from the reference helmet; the reference this repository carries
 * (`docs/design-handoff-astrolabe/Databricks App UI.dc.html`) stops at anchor
 * `#20d`, has no `#21a` and declares none of the seven. So they are written from
 * the phase windows the spec states in milliseconds, which it gives precisely, and
 * they live in first-open.css rather than in astrolabe-animation.css --
 * `astrolabe-keyframes.test.ts` holds that partial equal to the reference value for
 * value, and an eighth animation the reference has never heard of would fail it,
 * correctly. If a newer export lands, replace these against it.
 *
 * WHY THE WINDOWS ARE MILLISECONDS AND NOT PERCENTAGES. The spec's own numbers are
 * production milliseconds ("Click (0-120ms)", "Card exit (120-360ms)") with the
 * note that the review mock loops at 7s and every phase scales proportionally.
 * Production is the thing being built, so production is what is written down, and
 * `MOCK_SECONDS` records the other end of that ratio so a reader comparing the two
 * has both numbers rather than one and a memory.
