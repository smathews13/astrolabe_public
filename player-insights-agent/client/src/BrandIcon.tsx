/**
 * A Databricks product's official mark, at one of the handoff's four sizes.
 *
 * The whole API:
 *
 *     <BrandIcon product="unity-catalog" />               // 16px, a table row
 *     <BrandIcon product="genie" size={14} />             // a chip inside a card
 *     <BrandIcon product="mlflow" size={12} />            // a wordmark, 12px TALL
 *     <BrandIcon product="apps" size={18} className="…" /> // an architecture node
 *     <BrandIcon product="mosaic-ai" size={14} labelled /> // no text label beside it
 *
 * `product` is a slug from `brand-icons.ts`, which is the one place a product is
 * paired with its artwork. Add a product there, not here.
 *
 * DECORATIVE BY DEFAULT, and that is the whole of the accessibility story. Every
 * placement the handoff asks for puts the mark immediately left of the product's
 * own name -- "Sources", a table name, a node title, an endpoint. A mark that
 * announced itself there would make a screen reader read the product twice, so
 * the wrapper is `aria-hidden` and the name beside it does the announcing. This
 * is what `AstrolabeMark` already does for the agent's own mark, for the same
 * reason: it is `aria-hidden` unless a seating passes `label`, which is the
 * case where the mark is the only thing identifying what it labels.
 *
 * `labelled` is the exception, for the one seating where there IS no text: the
 * 22px kind chip on an agent-map card, where the card's line below names the
 * tool but not the product. That gets a `title`, which is what the chip carried
 * before this component existed. Do not reach for it anywhere the product's name
 * is already on the line -- a tooltip repeating the word next to it is noise the
 * reader cannot dismiss.
 *
 * The artwork is inlined rather than loaded through `<img>` so the file that
 * publishes is the file that renders and a test can hold the two together.
 *
 * NOTHING IS RECOLOURED HERE, AND THE MARKS ARE NOT IN THEIR PUBLISHED INK. Both
 * are true and they are not in tension: the recolour lives in the committed
 * artwork, as a second cut of each mark under `assets/logo/theme/`, so what
 * renders is still a file somebody reviewed rather than a `filter` this
 * component applied to one. `brand.css` still sets geometry and never ink. The
 * underlying question was settled on 2026-08-17 -- recolouring official
 * geometry into one palette is permitted, redrawing is not -- and the ruling is
 * recorded in `assets/brand/README.md` and `assets/logo/README.md`.
