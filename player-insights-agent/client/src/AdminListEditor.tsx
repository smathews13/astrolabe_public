/**
 * Who administers this deployment, and whether the role actually works for them.
 *
 * TWO FACTS PER ROW, NEVER MERGED. The role is a name on a list. The access is a
 * pair of Unity Catalog grants, on the app's telemetry schema and on the billing
 * system tables, which are what Monitoring and Ops read. An admin without those
 * grants opens two empty pages, so a row that showed only the role would be
 * telling a reader the appointment worked when it half did.
 *
 * The states are decided in admin-list.ts and the words come from the server, so
 * this file is markup, ARIA and the fetch calls. The three things it is careful
 * about:
 *
 *   - The access state is asked for in a POST on load, because reconciling makes
 *     grants and a GET must not. Until it answers, rows say "Not checked", which
 *     is this app's words for not yet everywhere and is not "no access".
 *   - A refusal prints the statement somebody with authority runs, in the same
 *     copyable panel Connections uses, because the refusal is the app saying it
 *     lacks the authority and the reader is the one who can fix it.
 *   - Removing somebody says what access went back with the role, which is only
 *     what this app granted. Access a person held for another reason is left
 *     alone and the row says so.
