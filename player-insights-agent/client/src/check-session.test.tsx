/**
 * That the Architecture tab stops forgetting what it checked, and does not lie
 * about when it checked it.
 *
 * WHAT WAS WRONG. The settings payload and the preflight report lived in the
 * page's own `useState`. Both are behind Refresh because each invokes the
 * serving endpoint, so they are expensive and deliberately never run on load.
 * Navigating away unmounted the page and took them with it, so coming back gave
 * every dependency `Not checked`, em-dashes in the tile strip, no index-age
 * pill, and "Not read yet" beside the button -- identical to a deployment
 * nobody had ever checked. The results were not slow to reproduce; it was
 * invisible that they needed reproducing.
 *
 * THE SECOND HALF IS THE HARDER ONE. A cache that restored the results and
 * re-stamped the clock would be worse than the defect: the page would say a
 * check had just run when nothing had run at all, and a reader would trust a
 * verdict about a deployment that may have changed hours ago. So the timestamp
 * is not remembered. It is read out of the payloads, where the SERVER recorded
 * it, and there is no field in the store that could be re-stamped. The
 * assertions below are mostly about that.
 *
 * The page is rendered rather than inspected, because the defect was a
 * relationship between a store, a mount and a header control and no one file
 * could see it. `renderToStaticMarkup` runs no effects, which is the state the
 * page opens in and the state this is about.
