/**
 * Where each node sits, and how the edges get between them.
 *
 * A HAND-ROLLED LAYOUT IN PIXELS, on a canvas of a fixed size, computed here
 * rather than measured in the DOM. The client bundle is already over 500 kB and
 * Databricks Apps forbids runtime CDNs, so there is no graph library to reach
 * for; and a layout that measured itself would be untestable without running a
 * browser, which is the one thing this work cannot do.
 *
 * IT USED TO BE PERCENTAGES ON A 0-100 SQUARE, and the reason it is not any more
 * is that a percentage layout has no fixed relationship between a card's width in
 * `ch` and the gap the edge labels need. Cards grew with their content, edge
 * captions ended up underneath them, and the graph reflowed into overlapping
 * boxes at the exact widths a laptop is set to. The design this now implements
 * states the canvas as {@link CANVAS_WIDTH} x {@link CANVAS_HEIGHT} and places
 * every card and every path in that one space, so a caption that clears a card
 * here clears it at every viewport. Narrow viewports SCROLL the canvas rather
 * than re-arranging it -- see architecture.css -- because a diagram that
 * rearranges itself is a second diagram nobody checked.
 *
 * SCROLLING IS THE BEHAVIOUR AT NARROW WIDTHS AND WAS ALSO THE BEHAVIOUR AT WIDE
 * ONES. The canvas was 1400 across and the widest the panel around it ever gets
 * is {@link CANVAS_MAX_WIDTH}, so every reader at every window size got a
 * horizontal scrollbar and the right-hand column against the edge. Nothing here
 * caught it: every check compared the layout to the canvas, and nothing compared
 * the canvas to the space it has to fit in. That check now exists, and the
 * drawing was tightened rather than scaled -- see the width table below.
 *
 * THE HEIGHTS USED TO BE ONE NUMBER FOR ALL TWELVE CARDS, and that number was
 * 140 while the columns were stacked on a 160px pitch. Both were wrong in the
 * same direction, and a card is as tall as the copy inside it: the ordinary
 * dependency cards come out at 157, the app's at 165, Lakebase's at 197 and the
 * Vector Search index card's at 229. Two things followed, and the checks in this
 * file could see neither, because every one of them reasoned about a card shorter
 * than any that is drawn:
 *
 *   - THE MIDDLE COLUMN RAN ON THREE PIXELS. 160 of pitch against 157 of card,
 *     three times over, where a caption needs twenty-four -- and `conversation`
 *     and `trace` are placed in gaps like those. Three pixels is not a layout, it
 *     is the distance to one. Any sentence added to a role paragraph, or a status
 *     word four characters longer, spent it and put a card over the title of the
 *     card beneath: the cards are opaque, and each is painted after the one above
 *     it in the middle column, so the one that loses is always the lower.
 *   - THE BOTTOM OF THE RIGHT COLUMN WAS CUT OFF. The Vector Search endpoint's
 *     card is 173 tall at top 620, which is 793 on a canvas that was 760 -- and
 *     `.arch-canvas-scroll` is `overflow-y: hidden`, so those 33px were not
 *     scrolled to, they were gone, and the "Open in Databricks" link in them with
 *     it. THE CANVAS HEIGHT IS A CLIP, not a bound the drawing is checked against
 *     for tidiness, which is why every card is now asserted to be inside it.
 *
 * Fitting the canvas to the panel -- the other half of what was reported, fixed
 * first -- scaled all of that down along with everything else.
 *
 * So the heights are now DERIVED, per card, from the box model in
 * architecture.css and the copy in architecture.ts -- see {@link nodeHeight} --
 * and the tops below are spaced to clear them by {@link ROW_GAP_MIN}. Nothing is
 * measured in the DOM and nothing needs to be: the one part that cannot be
 * computed is how wide a glyph sets, and that is an explicit upper bound which
 * errs towards a taller card. Growing downwards is free, because the page scrolls
 * vertically and only the sideways scroll was ever the complaint.

 * The canvas every position below is stated in.
 *
 * WIDTH: 1264, which is 30px inside {@link CANVAS_MAX_WIDTH}. It was 1400, from
 * the design, and 1400 has never fitted -- see the note at the top of this file.
 * The 136px came out of gaps, margins and four of the five column widths rather
 * than out of a `transform: scale()`, because a scaled canvas draws 13px type at
 * 11.7px, softens every glyph on the page's densest surface, and puts each card's
 * click target a few pixels from where it is painted.
 *
 * THE SAME TRADE WAS MADE A SECOND TIME, and it is the whole of the answer to
 * "the bubbles are crowding each other". Every column got NARROWER again and
 * every gap got WIDER, at a canvas that did not grow by a pixel:
 *
 *     margin  8 ->  12    browser 152 -> 140    gap 52 ->  74
 *     app   196 -> 184    gap      46 ->  62    agent 220 -> 208
 *     gap    60 ->  68    middle  250 -> 232    gap   46 ->  62
 *     right 226 -> 210    margin    8 ->  12
 *
 * 70px came off the five cards and went into the four corridors, because a
 * corridor is where the captions are and a card that loses width only gets
 * taller. THE CARDS PAID FOR THE AIR IN THE ONE CURRENCY THIS DRAWING HAS
 * SPARE. Narrowing the middle column used to be refused here on the grounds
 * that a line added to a role paragraph was an overlap; that stopped being true
 * when the tops were spaced off the real heights, and this is the change that
 * spends what that bought. The four middle cards are 173, 157, 157 and 245 at
 * 232 wide, against 157, 157, 157 and 229 at 250, and every pixel of that went
 * downwards where the page already scrolls.
 *
 * EVERY GAP IS SIZED BY THE LONGEST WORD STANDING IN IT plus
 * {@link LABEL_CLEAR_MIN} at each end, which is the rule the old table was
 * missing rather than a number picked to look right. The first gap held
 * "question" -- 8 characters of 10px mono, 49.6px -- in 52, so the caption had
 * about a pixel of white on each side of it and read as touching both cards.
 * That passed every check in this file, because not-overlapping was all any of
 * them asked.
 *
 * THE 30px IS NOT SPARE AND SHOULD NOT BE SPENT. A desktop scrollbar takes its
 * width out of the layout viewport, so a 1440px window lays the shell out in
 * about 1425 and the panel offers about 1279 rather than the 1294 above. The
 * ceiling is the no-scrollbar case; the slack is what makes the real one fit.
 *
 * HEIGHT: 912, which is the middle column stacked and a 36px margin under it,
 * matching the 36 it starts at. That column is the tallest: four cards of 173,
 * 157, 157 and 245 with {@link ROW_GAP_MIN} between them, so 36 + 173 + 36 + 157
 * + 36 + 157 + 36 + 245 = 876, and 36 under that.
 *
 * It was 760, then 832, and 760 was not a margin short, it was a CLIP: the
 * scroller around this canvas is `overflow-y: hidden` and the canvas is given
 * this height in pixels, so the 33px by which the right-hand column overran it
 * were not reachable by scrolling. Height is the cheap dimension here -- the page
 * itself scrolls, and sideways scroll was the whole of the complaint -- which is
 * why the answer to a card that needs more room is always to give it more room.

 * the right-hand column was still cut off at the edge, which is what a reader
 * reports as labels hidden behind the frame. Scrolling was the documented answer
 * and it is the wrong one, because a diagram read through a letterbox is a
 * diagram whose right half nobody looks at.
 *
 * So the canvas is fitted to the panel instead, down to this floor. The floor was
 * 0.72, chosen for how small it draws the type: 13px at about 9px, "the point at
 * which shrinking further costs more than a scrollbar does". That is a judgement
 * about legibility with no arithmetic behind it, and it was one pixel on the
 * wrong side of the window it was presumably picked for -- a 1024px window lays

 * 908 / 1264 = 0.7185. At 0.72 that window draws 910 into 908 and gets a two
 * pixel scrollbar: all of the shrinking, none of the fit.
 *
 * So it is derived rather than chosen, and rounded DOWN, because the point of
 * the floor is that everything above it fits. Raising it instead was the other
 * option and is the wrong one: it buys back a fraction of a pixel of type by
 * reintroducing the horizontal scrollbar this whole mechanism exists to remove.
 * At the widths a reader is actually on -- see the table in

 * orchestrator talks to, then the compute and the governed source behind Genie.
 *
 * STORAGE IS THE BOTTOM ROW, and that is load-bearing rather than tidy. Lakebase
 * and the MLflow experiment sit below the two things that WRITE them, off to the
 * side of the left-to-right path, because neither is ever read to produce an
 * answer. Drawing either in line would say it was.
 *
 * The two semantic cards are the exception to that row, and they always were:
 * the index is drawn low on the far right and is on the answer path, and the
 * endpoint that serves it sits in the column to its right, beneath the warehouse
 * and the catalog. That column is what-runs-it -- Genie's SQL runs on the
 * warehouse, a search runs on the endpoint -- so the pairing is the one the rest
 * of the drawing already uses.
 *
 * THE TOPS ARE SPACED OFF THE HEIGHTS rather than off a pitch, which is the fix
 * for the overlap. Every one of them is still a literal, because where a card
 * sits is a decision the design made, and a computed top would drift away from
 * the literal paths below it. What is no longer a decision is how much room a
 * card needs; architecture-layout.test.ts checks each column against
 * {@link nodeHeight} plus {@link ROW_GAP_MIN} rather than trusting the
 * arithmetic that produced these:
 *
 *     x=226   app 300 + 181 = 481       ->  lakebase 541     (60, for a caption)
 *     x=472   agent 290 + 157 = 447     ->  experiment 541   (94; the two stores
 *                                                             share a row)
 *     x=748   llm 36 + 173 = 209        ->  dictionary 245   (36)
 *             dictionary 245 + 157 = 402 -> data 438         (36)
 *             data 438 + 157 = 595      ->  index 631        (36)
 *     x=1042  warehouse 260 + 173 = 433 ->  catalog 485      (52, for a caption)
 *             catalog 485 + 157 = 642   ->  endpoint 686     (44)
 *
 * The columns do not overlap sideways, so those seven pairs are the whole of the
 * collision question for the cards. THE 60 AND THE 52 ARE NOT SLACK:
 * "governed reads" is fourteen characters placed inside the right column's own x
 * range, so the only thing keeping it out from under a card is the gap it sits
 * in, and the same is true of "conversation" and "trace" above the storage row.
 * A gap holding a caption is sized for the caption plus {@link LABEL_CLEAR_MIN}
 * above and below it, which is why those three are wider than the rest.
