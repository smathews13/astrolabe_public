/**
 * A repeating read that only runs while somebody is looking at the tab.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A MODULE AND NOT SIX LINES INSIDE THE HOOK. This repository has no
 * jsdom and no React testing library, so a `setInterval` written inside
 * `useEffect` is code no test in this suite can observe: effects do not run
 * under `renderToStaticMarkup`, and there is no `document` to hide. The one
 * claim worth pinning here -- that a backgrounded tab stops asking -- would
 * therefore have been untestable, and it is exactly the kind of claim that fails
 * silently. Nothing breaks when a paused poll quietly keeps running; the tab
 * just spends somebody's battery and fills the app log with requests nobody
 * reads.
 *
 * So the timer, the visibility listener and the decision between them live here,
 * behind a {@link PollHost} the caller supplies. The app supplies one built from
 * `document`; a test supplies a fake and drives it.
 *
 * WHAT COUNTS AS HIDDEN is the browser's answer, not ours. `document.hidden` is
 * true when the tab is not the active one in its window, or the window is
 * minimised -- it is NOT true merely because another window is in front, which
 * is the case people expect it to cover and it does not. That is the right line
 * for this: a tab visible behind a code editor is still a tab somebody is
 * glancing at.

/**
 * Run `read` now and every `intervalMs` after, but only while the tab is visible.
 *
 * Three behaviours, and each one is a decision rather than a detail:
 *
 *  - **Hidden at the start means nothing is read at all.** Not one request and
 *    no interval. A tab opened in the background has nobody to show an answer
 *    to, and the read it would have made is superseded by the one it makes the
 *    moment somebody actually looks.
 *  - **Becoming visible reads IMMEDIATELY**, then restarts the interval from
 *    that instant. Waiting up to a full interval to find out what happened while
 *    the tab was away is the worst of both worlds: it is the state a reader is
 *    most likely to be looking at stale numbers in.
 *  - **A second visibility event while already running changes nothing.** The
 *    handle guard is what makes that true. Without it a browser that fires
 *    `visibilitychange` twice -- and they do -- would leave two intervals
 *    running against one stop function, so the poll would silently double its
 *    rate and never come back down.
 *
 * Returns the teardown, which unsubscribes AND stops the interval. Both halves
 * matter: a listener left behind on an unmounted component would restart a
 * timer nothing is left to clear.
