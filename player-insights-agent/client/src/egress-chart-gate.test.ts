/**
 * The chart image download is off unless this deployment says otherwise.
 *
 * A separate file from `chart-read-only.test.ts` because the two guarantees are
 * separate and fail for separate reasons. That one says a figure cannot be typed
 * over; this one says a figure cannot be downloaded without the deployment having
 * permitted it. They meet at one object, and `toImage` moved out of that file's
 * keep-list into this one when the gate landed.
 *
 * ── WHY BOTH STATES ARE ASSERTED ──
 *
 * A gate that is always closed passes a test for the closed state and is not a
 * control, it is a deletion. The switch has to be able to come back on, because
 * an administrator who turns it on and sees no change would reasonably conclude
 * the whole panel is decorative.
