/**
 * What the composer's paperclip is doing, as one decision rather than three

 *
 * The control had no state of its own at all. It was `disabled={loading ||
 * conversationLoading}` and a fixed label, which leaves out the one moment it
 * most needs to say something: while a file it just accepted is being read,
 * uploaded and parsed. That is seconds of work for a PDF, and for the whole of
 * it the button looked exactly as it does at rest -- so the only reasonable
 * reading was that nothing had happened, and the reasonable response was to
 * press it again. Doing so starts a second `uploadAttachments` over the same
 * `<input>`, whose `value` the first one clears on its way out.
 *
 * Split out here rather than inlined because the app's tests run without a DOM:
 * a decision in JSX cannot be asserted, and this one has four states and a
 * precedence between them.
