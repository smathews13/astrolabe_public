/**
 * The app opening (`#19a`): a night sky, the four concepts, the wordmark.
 *
 * The full-viewport half of the sequence. The gate that rises over it at 60% is
 * the REAL gate and is not drawn here -- `loading-suite.md`: "The gate is the real
 * gate (login-gate.md); the sequence only precedes it." `FirstOpenGate` owns both
 * and is where the clock lives.
 *
 * THE SKY OUTLIVES THE INTRO, and that is the one thing about this component worth
 * reading twice. "The constellation keeps drawing behind the gate" is the spec's
 * own sentence, so this layer stays mounted for as long as the gate is on screen
 * rather than unmounting after ten seconds. The constellation's own animations are
 * `infinite` loops, so it goes on drawing without anything having to restart it,
 * and the gate never flips from a navy backdrop to an Ice one under the reader.
 *
 * What DOES end is the middle: the concepts and the wordmark are one-shot
 * animations that are over by 64% of the sequence, and the component stops
 * rendering them once the gate is up. A concept mark cycling behind a login card
 * would be the app still introducing itself to somebody who is trying to read
 * their own email address.
 *
 * DECORATIVE, ENTIRELY. The whole layer is `aria-hidden`: it says nothing a screen
 * reader can use, and the gate that follows it carries the words. There is no
 * `aria-live` here at all -- the one status string §5 allows on this surface is the
 * gate's own copy, and a live region announcing an animation would be read out
 * over it.
 *
 * `leaving` IS THE OTHER END OF THE SAME SEQUENCE. `login-transition.md` has the
 * sky go out the way it came in: the stars travel to the lockup and the layer fades
 * as the app crossfades up under it. It is a prop rather than a second component
 * because the thing leaving has to be the sky the reader has been looking at, with
 * the stars in the positions they popped in.
