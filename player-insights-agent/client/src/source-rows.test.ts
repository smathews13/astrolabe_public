/**
 * Which tables a row is drawn for, and what its chip is allowed to say.
 *
 * The two defects behind this file are one defect seen twice. An answer
 * comparing recurrent spending with net bookings showed a single source -- the
 * data dictionary the agent had looked the two terms up in -- and the tables
 * the figures actually came from were nowhere on screen. Both surfaces rendered
 * `sources[0]`, and the list arrives in the order the run read them, so the
 * lookup that ran first was the one thing a reader saw. Naming all of them
 * fixes half of it: the dictionary is a source of the ANSWER and not a source
 * of its NUMBERS, and a list that presents the two identically is a shorter way
 * of making the same false claim.
 *
 * So the ordering, the deduplication and the chip vocabulary live here, away
 * from the renderer, and the rule the file exists to hold is in its header: a
 * role is stated or it is not, and nothing here infers one.
