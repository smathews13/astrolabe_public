/**
 * What is set apart inside a caveat, and — the half that matters more — what is
 * left exactly as the agent wrote it.
 *
 * The Keep in mind section is a block of amber prose in which everything weighs
 * the same, which is what a reader said about it: to find which table a warning
 * is about, or how big "understated" turned out to be, they had to read every
 * bullet to the end. Bolding the numbers and tagging the table is the answer to
 * that, and it is also the first thing in this card that TOUCHES a disclosure
 * on its way to the screen. So the round trip below is the load-bearing test in
 * the file: the runs must concatenate back to the caveat, character for
 * character, whatever the regex did or failed to do.
