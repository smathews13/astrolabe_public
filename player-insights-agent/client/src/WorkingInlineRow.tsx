/**
 * The flicker's inline seating (`#17a`): one row, one mark, one real number.
 *
 * `loading-suite.md`: "Inline row: 20px mark + 'Working on your question' 500 +
 * right-pinned mono elapsed time." It is the loading suite's narrow seating, for
 * a column that a 520px constellation panel does not fit in.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT A LIVE REGION, when the two constellation panels are. §5 allows
 * one `aria-live="polite"` string per surface and the surface this sits on already
 * spends it: the inspector's head carries `RunStatusPill`, which is a
 * `role="status"` and announces "Live · step 8" as the run moves. A second region
 * six pixels below it, saying the same run is in flight in different words, would
 * interrupt the first every time the count ticked. The label is visible and the
 * pill is what speaks.
 *
 * The mark is decorative and `ConceptFlicker` marks it so. Under
 * `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` the guard in astrolabe-animation.css leaves the
 * d-pad still in the slot, so the row keeps a mark rather than emptying out.
