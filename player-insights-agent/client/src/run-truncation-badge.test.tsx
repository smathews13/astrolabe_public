/**
 * Whether a run that stopped early says so in the list.
 *
 * The badge was specified, the styles for it existed, and it could not have
 * drawn on any run in any deployment: `/api/runs` did not carry the fact, so the
 * condition behind it was reading a field the row never had. A badge that is
 * silently always absent is worse than no badge, because the list then reads as
 * a positive statement that nothing was cut short.
 *
 * Both directions are asserted for that reason. A test that only checks the
 * truncated case passes just as well against a badge rendered unconditionally,
 * which is the same defect facing the other way: every run marked as incomplete
 * teaches the reader to ignore the mark.
