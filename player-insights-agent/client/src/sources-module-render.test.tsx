/**
 * What the Sources module actually puts on screen, rendered and read back.
 *
 * A render rather than assertions about the source text, and that is the whole
 * point of the file. The defect this suite was written for was a table name run
 * into the words after it -- "…data_dictionaryRead during this run", one word,
 * half of it an identifier -- and every source-level claim anyone would think to
 * write was TRUE while it was on screen. Nothing short of composing the text and
 * reading it back could fail. `textContent` is also what a screen reader is
 * handed, so a run of text with no separator is not merely ugly; it is the
 * identifier being announced as part of the next sentence.
 *
 * Rendered through `renderToStaticMarkup`, so no effect runs: the tracked-table
 * and workspace-host reads both land after mount, and this sees the state every
 * surface passes through first -- the name unlinked, no "Open in Databricks"
 * control. That is deliberate. What the module says about a table must not
 * depend on whether the name turned out to be a link.
 */

/**
 * A three-level name in the shape the app cites one, with the deployment's own
