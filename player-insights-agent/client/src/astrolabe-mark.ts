/**
 * The astrolabe mark, as geometry rather than as a picture.
 *
 * THE RULE THE WHOLE FILE EXISTS TO KEEP IS "NEVER REDRAW, NEVER RESTROKE"
 * (`astrolabe-rebuild-spec.md` §1, and `assets/logo/README.md` in as many words).
 * Every number below is read off the delivered SVG in `assets/logo/`, and
 * `astrolabe-mark.test.ts` reads those same files off disk and fails if one
 * coordinate, radius, stroke width or dash pattern here differs from them. So
 * this is not a second drawing of the mark; it is the delivered drawing, in a
 * form a component can size and ink.
 *
 * WHY NOT JUST `<img src="astrolabe-dpad.svg">`, which would make redrawing
 * impossible by construction. Three seatings the design asks for cannot be had
 * from the two delivered inks:
 *
 *   1. The in-button loader is ALL white -- rim, cross and accent dots -- on the
 *      blue primary button (`loading-suite.md`, Seatings). The `-white` files
 *      keep #6FAEDD on the accents, which disappears on blue.
 *   2. The small cut is a different drawing of the same mark and is not one of
 *      the delivered files: §1 specifies it numerically and nothing ships it.
 *   3. An `<img>` cannot be handed the two inks by CSS, so a mark that has to
 *      survive a repaint of the palette would be eight files instead of one.
 *
 * So the paints are named rather than written: every element says `ink` or
 * `accent`, and `--ast-mark-ink` / `--ast-mark-accent` in astrolabe-mark.css
 * decide what those are for the surface the mark is standing on. That is also
 * what keeps this file out of palette.test.ts's way -- there is no hex here.
