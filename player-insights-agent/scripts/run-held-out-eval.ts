/**
 * Runs the held-out evaluation set and writes the scorecard the Benchmark Lab
 * renders.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT AND NOT A ROUTE. The suite takes minutes and the result
 * is published rather than live: a committed scorecard carries the date and the
 * model version it was produced against, which is what stops a number on that
 * pane being read as current. A button would produce a figure with no such
 * anchor. `POST /api/benchmarks/run` can run this suite too -- the runner
 * resolves `held-out-eval` like any other id -- and that path is the right one
 * for looking, but the scorecard on the pane comes from here.
 *
 * WHAT IS INJECTED AND WHAT IS REAL. The scoring, the case list, the judging,
 * the identity handling and the suite control flow are all the real
 * `startBenchmarkRun`, imported unmodified. Two things are supplied by this
 * script because the app supplies them in production: the transport, and the
 * store.
 *
 *   The transport is the same POST to the same serving endpoint with the same
 *   body `buildAskServingBody` produces, carrying the caller's OAuth token in
 *   `Authorization`. That is what makes this the signed-in path in the sense
 *   that matters: the agent's identity gate reads the forwarded token, resolves
 *   it to a person, and the run reads governed data under that person's grants.
 *   NOTHING HERE FALLS BACK TO A SERVICE PRINCIPAL. If the token is missing or
 *   rejected the run is refused and the refusal is the result.
 *
 *   The store is in-memory. Lakebase is where a run belongs when the app records
 *   it for a user to find later; this run's product is a committed file, and
 *   writing a benchmark row into the customer's demo database for an evaluation
 *   nobody will look up there would be litter.
 *
 * RUN IT WITH:
 *   DATABRICKS_CONFIG_PROFILE="<profile>" \
 *   PLAYER_INSIGHTS_SERVING_ENDPOINT=<agent endpoint> \
 *   npx tsx scripts/run-held-out-eval.ts
 *
 * Nothing here is deployed, restarted or re-logged by running it. It invokes an
 * endpoint that is already serving, twelve times.
