// Whether the app's Postgres role owns the objects it maintains.
//
// Ownership, not privileges, and the two are not interchangeable. The app's DDL
// runs `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` at every boot, and Postgres
// checks ownership before it decides the statement is a no-op, so a table
// created by a developer's role is refused for as long as it exists. Grants do
// not help, and neither does re-running grant-app-db-access.mjs: the developer
// role cannot hand ownership over, because `ALTER ... OWNER TO` requires
// membership in the target role and Lakebase withholds the ADMIN OPTION needed
// to grant it. The only remedy is to let the app create the objects itself.
//
// The condition is reached by pointing local development at the branch the
// deployed app uses, which is the one thing that makes it likely rather than
// theoretical.
//
// Everything is discovered from the app, so there is nothing to keep in step by
// hand:
//   node scripts/check-db-ownership.mjs --app <app-name> --profile <profile>
//
// Exits 0 when the app owns its schema, or when the schema does not exist yet,
// which is the normal state of a deployment whose app has never booted.
