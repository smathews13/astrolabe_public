/**
 * Where certificates and attestations are kept.
 *
 * NOT LAKEBASE, DELIBERATELY, and this is the reason rather than an omission.
 * The plan proposes Lakebase tables. The app OWNS the `player_insights` schema
 * and its boot DDL is refused on any object it does not own, which is the
 * failure `scripts/check-db-ownership.mjs` exists to catch and which
 * `bundle/app-release.sh` now halts a release over. A release script that
 * created certificate tables would create them as the DEPLOYER's Postgres role
 * and would be manufacturing that exact failure on every release. A separate
 * schema owned by the release role is the way to do it later; it is a schema,
 * a grant and a migration, and it is not free.
 *
 * So: files. Flat JSON under a directory, one file per issued certificate,
 * named so the newest for a release is findable without an index.
 *
 * The directory is NOT committed. A certificate names the workspace, the app,
 * the endpoint, the Lakebase branch and every table in the manifest, and the
 * publication rewrite is a line-wise pass that cannot remove a document. The
 * cost is that the store is per-machine, so `--store` takes a path: point it at
 * shared storage and the records are shared.
