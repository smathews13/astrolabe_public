/**
 * The certificate as something a person reads at the end of a release.
 *
 * Ordered by what a reader has to act on: the verdict, then the failures, then
 * the things nothing established, then what passed, and last the standing list
 * of conditions no API will ever answer.
 *
 * THE UNVERIFIABLE SECTION IS PRINTED ON EVERY RUN, INCLUDING A CLEAN ONE. It
 * is the part of the report with the shortest shelf life in a reader's memory
 * and the longest consequences: a certificate that says PASS while four
 * conditions were never observed is only honest if the reader is told so at the
 * moment they read PASS, not in a document they would have to go and find.
