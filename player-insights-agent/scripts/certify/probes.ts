/**
 * One function per check, from an observation to a verdict. No IO.
 *
 * Split from the runner so that every rule about what counts as a pass is
 * testable without a workspace, and so that the runner is only allowed to be
 * wrong about what it FETCHED, never about what it CONCLUDED.
 *
 * TWO RULES THAT EVERY PROBE HERE FOLLOWS.
 *
 * A missing observation is `unknown`, never `pass`. Each probe takes its input
 * as nullable and the null branch says which call did not answer. Reading an
 * absent payload as an empty one produces "no missing scopes" from an app that
 * was never fetched, which is precisely the shape of the reassuring green line
 * this whole exercise exists to remove.
 *
 * A probe reports what it OBSERVED and nothing wider. `AGENT_ENDPOINT_REACHABLE`
 * passing means the endpoint answered, and the detail says in as many words
 * that nothing behind it was covered, because the endpoint stopped reporting
 * its dependencies and the app now receives `preflight_retired`.
