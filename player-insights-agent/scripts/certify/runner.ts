/**
 * Everything the certification decides, given everything it observed.
 *
 * Pure. The IO that produces `Observations` lives in `observe.ts`, so the rules
 * can be tested against a fabricated deployment without a workspace, and so a
 * run against a real one can be replayed from its recorded observations.
 *
 * THE CATALOGUE IS THE LOOP, NOT THIS FILE. Every required check in
 * `catalogue.ts` gets a result, and a check with no probe gets the honest
 * outcome the catalogue prescribes. Adding a code to the catalogue and
 * forgetting to run it therefore produces a visible `unknown` rather than
 * silence, which is the whole reason the aggregation counts a missing result as
 * unresolved.
