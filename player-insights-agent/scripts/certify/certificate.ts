/**
 * The record a promotion is allowed to rely on, and the rules that decide
 * whether it says PASS.
 *
 * THREE OUTCOMES, NOT TWO. A certificate that could only say PASS or FAIL would
 * have to decide what to call a run where nothing went wrong and half the
 * catalogue could not be observed, and every such scheme eventually calls it
 * PASS. INCOMPLETE is that third answer, and it blocks a promotion exactly as
 * FAIL does. The difference is what a reader does next: FAIL names something to
 * fix, INCOMPLETE names something to find out.
 *
 * The digest is TAMPER-EVIDENT, NOT SIGNED. It catches a certificate edited by
 * hand or truncated in transit. It does not catch anyone who can also recompute
 * it, because there is no key here and inventing a key store for a file written
 * next to the tree it describes would buy nothing. Do not describe these as
 * signed anywhere.
