/**
 * The only file here that talks to anything.
 *
 * THROUGH THE APP'S OWN PUBLIC ROUTES, WITH THE OPERATOR'S OWN TOKEN. Not
 * through a diagnostic side door and not as the app service principal. The
 * point of certifying a deployment is to exercise the boundary a user crosses,
 * and a check that reaches around that boundary certifies a path nobody uses.
 * The bundle's storage checks established the same rule and wrote down why: a
 * psql session proves the grants exist, not that the app picked them up.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE DECIDES ANYTHING. Every function returns what it saw or null,
 * and null means the call did not answer. The probes turn that into `unknown`.
 * An error swallowed into an empty object would arrive at a probe as a
 * deployment with no scopes and no attachments, which reads as a finding about
 * the release rather than about the network.
