/**
 * The guard refuses exactly one situation, and it is the one that happened.
 *
 * A local development server was pointed at the Lakebase branch the deployed app
 * uses. It booted, ran the app's DDL, and three tables that had just been ADDED
 * to that DDL did not exist yet -- so nothing refused them. They were created,
 * owned by the developer, and the next release was blocked: the app cannot
 * maintain tables it does not own, and ownership cannot be handed back, because
 * `ALTER ... OWNER TO` needs `SET ROLE` on the owner and Lakebase does not grant
 * a human that over a service principal. They were empty, so dropping them was
 * survivable. A table with rows in it would not have been.
 *
 * THE HALF THAT MATTERS MORE THAN THE REFUSAL is that nothing else is refused. A
 * guard that fires on a healthy deployment is a guard somebody deletes, and this
 * one sits in front of every boot of the app in front of the customer. Three of
 * the four cases below have to proceed, and they are the reason the condition
 * asks Postgres about role membership rather than comparing two strings.
