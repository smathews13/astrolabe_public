/**
 * Whether the credential a benchmark suite is executing under will last long
 * enough to finish it, and what to do at the moment it does not.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS ITS OWN PROBLEM. Everywhere else in the app, a forwarded token is
 * used once, inside one HTTP request, and its lifetime is somebody else's
 * concern. A benchmark suite is the exception: it is started by one request and
 * then runs unattended for minutes, invoking the endpoint once per case with a
 * token that was minted for a request that returned long ago. So a suite can
 * outlive its own credential, and the interesting question is what happens on
 * the case after that.
 *
 * THE ANSWER MUST NOT BE "CARRY ON AS THE APPLICATION". That is the exact defect
 * the whole user-authorization workstream exists to delete, and reintroducing it
 * here would be the worst place to have it: on a surface that produces numbers
 * people quote, where half a suite scored under a reader's grants and half under
 * an application's would still render as one run with one pass rate. There is no
 * re-identification path in this module, and there is nothing for one to be
 * built out of: it decides only whether the run may CONTINUE.
 *
 * So the design is two checks and no fallback, and they divide the problem
 * between them rather than overlapping.
 *
 *  1. BEFORE THE RUN STARTS, refuse if the token says it expires before the
 *     suite's own budget runs out. The suite cannot promise to finish, so it
 *     does not start, and the person is told while they are still looking at
 *     the screen rather than four minutes later. This is `coverage`, below.
 *  2. WHEN THE ENDPOINT REFUSES an identity-layer failure mid-suite, the run
 *     stops there and the cases it never reached are recorded as never reached.
 *     This is `endsTheSuite`, below, applied by the runner.
 *
 * THERE IS DELIBERATELY NO THIRD CHECK BETWEEN CASES, and the reason is worth
 * writing down because it looks like an omission. One was written and removed.
 * Check 1 guarantees `expiry >= start + budget`, and the runner abandons the
 * suite once `now - start > budget`, so a credential with a readable expiry can
 * never be observed dead at a case boundary: the budget runs out first, every
 * time, by construction. A credential with an unreadable expiry cannot be
 * checked at a boundary at all. So a between-cases check fires in exactly no
 * situation, and a check that cannot fire is worse than no check, because the
 * next reader takes it for the protection it appears to be.
 *
 * What is left uncovered by check 1 is real and is covered by check 2: a clock
 * that disagrees with the issuer's, a token revoked rather than expired, and
 * the one case a suite is allowed to overrun its budget by (the budget is
 * tested between cases, so the last case may start just inside it and run for
 * its full turn timeout). In all three the endpoint is the thing that finds
 * out, which is the correct authority anyway.
 *
 * A TOKEN THAT DECLARES NO EXPIRY IS NOT REFUSED, which mirrors the asymmetry
 * `identity-subject.ts` documents at length and is the same judgement: a
 * personal access token is an opaque string, it states no `exp`, and a rule that
 * refused every credential it could not read the lifetime of would take the
 * Benchmark Lab down in any workspace that issues them, on a check that would
 * have fired correctly zero times. Those runs rely entirely on check 2, and the
 * run records that its credential's lifetime was unknown so that a truncated one
 * is explicable afterwards.
