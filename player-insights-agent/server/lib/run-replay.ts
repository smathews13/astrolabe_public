/**
 * Answering a repeated request from what the first one already produced.
 *
 * This is the half of the replay work that can be built and tested without a
 * browser, and it is the half that matters: what a returning caller is served.
 * Whether it arrives as a JSON body or as an SSE `result` event is the
 * responder's business, and both go through the same body, so replay does not
 * get to be a second answer contract.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT REPLAYED, and this is a real gap rather than an oversight: the
 * stage narration. Stages are streamed as the agent produces them and nothing
 * stores them, so a caller who reconnects gets the answer without the run that
 * led to it. Storing stages in `run_events` is the obvious fix and belongs with
 * the work that maps stages onto run states, since both need the same hook.
