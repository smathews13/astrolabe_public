/**
 * What Unity Catalog says about the columns of a table, and nothing else.
 *
 * ── THE DETECTOR THIS FILE REFUSES TO BE ──
 *
 * The tempting version of this feature inspects values: it looks at a result set,
 * finds something shaped like an email address or a date of birth, and reports
 * that the export contained personal data. That version is worse than nothing and
 * it is worth being precise about why. It is wrong in both directions -- a
 * pseudonymous player id it has never seen a pattern for reads as clean, and a
 * free-text note column reads as sensitive because one row mentioned a street --
 * and being wrong is not even the main problem. The main problem is that it would
 * be BELIEVED. A green tick from an automated scan is read as a clearance by the
 * next person who sees it, and the person who most needs to be careful is the one
 * it most reassures.
 *
 * So this file inspects no values. It asks the platform, which is the only party
 * in the system with an authoritative answer: Unity Catalog carries column tags,
 * column masks and row filters, the customer's own governance put them there, and
 * the governed schema already applies them at query time.
 *
 * ── THE THREE ANSWERS, AND THE FOURTH THAT DOES NOT EXIST ──
 *
 *   `classified`      The catalog carries a tag, a mask or a row filter here.
 *   `not-classified`  The catalog carries nothing that this reader can see.
 *   `not-checked`     The question could not be asked at all.
 *
 * THERE IS NO ANSWER MEANING "CONTAINS NO PERSONAL DATA", and none may be added.
 * `not-classified` is a statement about the CATALOG, not about the data: an
 * untagged table full of names is untagged, and this app has no way to know it is
 * full of names. The panel prints "Not classified" in a neutral chip for exactly
 * that reason, and `shared/egress-contract.ts` holds the wording so it cannot be
 * made more reassuring at one call site.
 *
 * There is a second reason `not-classified` cannot be read as clean, and it is
 * structural rather than cautious: Unity Catalog's `information_schema` is
 * FILTERED TO WHAT THE CALLER MAY SEE. A reader without privileges on the tags
 * gets an empty result, which is indistinguishable from a table nobody tagged.
 * The read is deliberately still made as that reader; see below.
 *
 * ── WHOSE CREDENTIALS THESE READS USE ──
 *
 * The signed-in administrator's own forwarded token, never the app's service
 * principal. Three service-principal read paths in this app were deliberately
 * closed and this file does not reopen one. No token means `not-checked`, which
 * is the honest answer and not a reason to fall back to a wider credential: an
 * app that reads the catalog with its own authority on a person's behalf is a way
 * of seeing more, and this whole capability exists to see less.
 *
 * The consequence is stated plainly and is not a defect: an administrator who
 * cannot read a table's tags is told the tags could not be read, rather than
 * being shown tags they have no grant for.

 * ── WHY THE SHAPE IS ENFORCED RATHER THAN ESCAPED ──
 *
 * These names reach a statement as literals, because the SQL Statement Execution
 * runner this file borrows takes a statement and no parameters. Escaping a quote
 * is the usual answer and it is the weaker one: it leaves the set of accepted
 * inputs open and relies on one function being right forever. So a name is
 * accepted only when every part matches the characters an unquoted Unity Catalog
 * identifier is made of, and anything else is refused and reported as
 * `not-checked`.
 *
 * The cost is real and small: a table whose name genuinely needs backticks is not
 * classified, and is reported as not classified rather than silently skipped.
 * These names arrive from a run's recorded sources, so the refusal is visible to
 * whoever declared the asset.
