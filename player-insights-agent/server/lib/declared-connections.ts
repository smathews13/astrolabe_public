/**
 * The assets this deployment says the agent should consider, and what removing
 * one costs.
 *
 * WHAT ADDING ONE DOES, AND THE THING IT DOES NOT DO. A row here records intent.
 * It does not grant anything, it does not widen what any person can read, and it
 * does not reach the running orchestrator: the tables the agent may query are
 * enumerated when the model is logged and baked into the artifact as the manifest
 * the SQL guard checks (see `shared/notebook-declaration.ts` for why that is a
 * safety property rather than a gap). A reader will assume the opposite, so
 * `addedConnectionEffect` states it and the surface shows it on the row.
 *
 * WHY REMOVAL IS A STATE CHANGE AND NOT A DELETE. The demo this app runs is a
 * conversation, and an asset withdrawn halfway through one is exactly when
 * somebody needs it back. A withdrawn row keeps its value, so restoring it is a
 * click rather than a three-part table name recalled from memory. `removalImpact`
 * is the other half of the same idea: it says what stops working BEFORE the
 * withdrawal, because the alternative is finding out from the next question.
