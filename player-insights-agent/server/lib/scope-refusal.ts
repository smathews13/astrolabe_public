/**
 * What a 403 that turned on an OAuth scope actually establishes, and what to do.
 *
 * WHAT THIS REPLACED, SO IT IS NOT PUT BACK. The Connections page used to answer
 * a scope refusal with one sentence and four steps. The sentence said "it is the
 * app that is short of a scope, not the reader of a grant", and nothing in the
 * code had read anything that could know that. The steps said: validate the
 * scope name, add it to `databricks.yml`, stop and start the app, sign out and
 * back in. Three of the four were already done and verified working on this
 * deployment, one row told the reader to add a scope the bundle already
 * declared, and the fourth rested on a consent model the documentation does not
 * support. The reader did them again and it did not help.
 *
 * THE MISSING FACT WAS WHAT THE APP ASKS FOR. Both remedies above are correct in
 * one case each, and picking between them needs the deployment's own
 * `user_api_scopes`. The container is now told them (`session-freshness.ts`,
 * `DECLARED_SCOPES_VAR`), so this no longer has to guess:
 *
 * - the app DOES declare the scope, and the presented sign-in demonstrably lacks
 *   it. A fresh sign-in is the reader's move, and it is offered without either
 *   candidate being asserted as the cause: one token cannot tell a session older
 *   than the declaration from an app that was never restarted. This is the same
 *   verdict `sessionFreshness` reaches from the other direction, and it
 *   deliberately carries the same `cause` string.
 * - the app declares it and the sign-in DOES carry it, and the workspace refused
 *   anyway. Then the scope is ruled out by the token itself and a grant is what
 *   is left, so this branch says so and offers no sign-in.
 * - the app does NOT declare it. Then no sign-in it hands out can carry it, the
 *   reader can do nothing at all, and the bundle edit is the whole fix. This is
 *   the only branch where the deploy steps are the right answer, and it is the
 *   branch the old code never distinguished.
 * - the deployment was not told what it declares. Then this is undetermined and
 *   carries NO remedy, because the two above are contradictory advice and
 *   picking one is the original defect.
 *
 * WHY THE SIGN-IN'S OWN SCOPES ARE AN INPUT AND NOT A SECOND READING OF THEM.
 * Two paths used to reach a verdict about the same 403 from different evidence.
 * `refusalCause` in `dependency-probes.ts` reads the token's scope claim through
 * a spelling table and decides whether the refusal was about a scope at all;
 * this function then re-decided WHICH scope problem it was from the declared list
 * alone. So a deployment whose reader held the scope, and whose workspace refused
 * for want of a GRANT, was told its sign-in did not carry a permission the token
 * plainly listed, and sent to a private window that could not help. Both readers
 * survive and neither is duplicated: the token verdict is computed once, beside
 * the call that produced the refusal, and handed here as `scopeHeld`.
 *
 * Registered in `server/lib/diagnosis-audit.test.ts`, which holds every branch
 * against `shared/stated-cause.ts`: prose on an undetermined verdict may not
 * assert a cause, an undetermined verdict may not carry a remedy, and a named
 * cause must quote what was read. See DECISIONS.md D10.
