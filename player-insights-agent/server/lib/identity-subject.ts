/**
 * Whether the token on a request belongs to the person the request says it is
 * from.
 *
 * Databricks Apps sets two independent things on an authenticated request:
 * `x-forwarded-email`, which is who the platform says signed in, and
 * `x-forwarded-access-token`, which is the credential every downstream call is
 * then made with. Everything the app records, scopes and displays is keyed on
 * the first. Everything that actually reads data is authorised by the second.
 * Nothing has ever checked that they name the same person.
 *
 * They should always agree, and the value of the check is not that they might
 * casually disagree. It is that "the answer was computed under the grants of
 * whoever the email says" is a claim the app makes on every screen, and until
 * this existed the app had no evidence for it at all. A mismatch here is the
 * one signal that the two halves came apart.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY CANNOT DO. It reads the token's own claims, so it
 * proves what the token SAYS about itself, not that Databricks issued it. The
 * signature is not verified and could not usefully be: the app has no issuer key,
 * and the token is about to be sent to Databricks, which does verify it and
 * refuses it if it is forged. This check catches the wrong REAL token, which is
 * the failure mode a signature check would not have caught either.
 *
 * NO CLAIM READ HERE MAY BE LOGGED, TRACED OR STORED beyond the subject, and
 * the subject only where the email already is. A token's claims are credentials
 * in every sense that matters, and a trace attribute is forever.
