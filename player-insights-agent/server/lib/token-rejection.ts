/**
 * What an HTTP 401 on a forwarded token establishes, and what it does not.
 *
 * THE ADVICE THIS REPLACES. Until now a 401 was answered with "Reload this page
 * to pick up a fresh token. If it persists, sign out of the workspace and back
 * in, then open the app again." Three actions, offered as a sequence, none of
 * them derived from anything the code had read:
 *
 * - A reload only replaces the token if the token had run out. The proxy in
 *   front of this app hands over the token it holds; if that token is live and
 *   Databricks refused it anyway, a reload presents the same live token and
 *   collects the same refusal. That is a loop, and the copy sent readers round
 *   it with no way to know they were in one.
 * - Signing out of the Databricks workspace does not clear this app's sign-in.
 *   The app is served from its own host and keeps its own session there. This
 *   is the step a reader tries first, and it has never worked.
 *
 * WHAT IS ACTUALLY KNOWABLE HERE, and it is more than nothing. The forwarded
 * token carries its own expiry. Comparing that claim against the clock
 * separates the two cases that the old copy ran together:
 *
 * - The expiry has passed. The token really had run out, and a reload really is
 *   the fix, because a page load is what makes the proxy hand over a new one.
 * - The expiry has not passed. The token was live when Databricks refused it,
 *   so its age is not the reason and a reload cannot help. What replaces the
 *   token rather than re-presenting it is a new sign-in.
 *
 * And where the expiry cannot be read at all, that is said plainly and the
 * action offered is the one that covers both, rather than the one that covers
 * the case somebody guessed at. That is the rule this module is written to,
 * recorded as D10 in `bundle/DECISIONS.md`.
 *
 * Every branch is a {@link Diagnosis}, and every branch is registered in
 * `server/lib/diagnosis-audit.test.ts`. That registration is the point of
 * putting the copy here rather than inline in `access-verification.ts`, where
 * it sat outside the guard entirely.
