/**
 * Which principal an ask request may be executed under, decided once per request.
 *
 * Three modules meet here and each owns a different question.
 * `identity-subject.ts` answers "does the forwarded token belong to the person
 * this request says it is from", by reading the token. `terminal-response.ts`
 * answers "what shape does a request that will not be answered come back in".
 * This one answers the question neither of them can: given that binding, and
 * given where this process is running, may the request proceed, and with which
 * credential.
 *
 * IT IS THE ABSENCE OF A BRANCH THAT MATTERS HERE. There used to be one path
 * through the ask route for a request whose token worked and another for a
 * request whose token did not, and the second called the endpoint with the app's
 * own service principal. So a reader could be shown an answer computed under an
 * application's grants on a screen that said their access had been checked. This
 * module produces either a credential to execute as, or a refusal. There is no
 * third return value, and that is deliberately a property of the type rather
 * than of anybody's care at the call site.
 *
 * THE VOCABULARY OF `mode` IS DEFINED HERE, which `terminal-response.ts` defers
 * to by typing it as a string.
