/**
 * The three tables the admin role keeps: who was added, what admins did, and
 * which Unity Catalog grants this app is the reason for.
 *
 * A separate module from admin-roles.ts for the reason run-ledger-schema.ts is
 * separate from run-ledger.ts: the boot path has to reach the statements, and
 * the logic has to reach the caller's identity, and putting both in one file
 * makes insights-routes.ts and this file import each other.
 *
 * THE SAME RULES APPLY HERE AS TO THE RUN LEDGER, and they are worth restating
 * because `applySchema` runs this list at every start of the deployed app,
 * against a database holding the customer's conversation history:
 *
 *   1. Nothing alters an existing table. `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT
 *      EXISTS` is REFUSED when the app's Postgres role does not own the table,
 *      because ownership is checked before the statement is found to be a
 *      no-op. Every constraint below is declared inside its own CREATE.
 *   2. Nothing drops, renames or rewrites anything.
 *   3. Every statement is a no-op the second time.
 *   4. No table name here is used by anything else in the schema, so a
 *      `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` here cannot quietly resolve to somebody
 *      else's table and start writing rows into it.
 *
 * NO TABLE HERE IS THE WHOLE ADMIN LIST. The seed list is read from the process
 * environment, so an unreachable Lakebase leaves the deployment administerable
 * by whoever was named at deployment. See admin-roles.ts.

   *
   *   app-granted   The privilege was absent, and this app added it. Removing
   *                 the admin revokes it.
   *   pre-existing  The privilege was already there. Removing the admin leaves
   *                 it alone, and the editor says so rather than staying quiet.
   *   unknown       The check could not be made, usually because the acting
   *                 admin cannot read grants on the object. NEVER REVOKED.
   *                 Unknown is not evidence, and the safe reading of no
   *                 evidence is to change nothing.
   *
   * Keyed on person, object and privilege, because one person holds several
   * privileges on several objects and each has its own provenance. A row is
   * replaced rather than duplicated on a re-grant: the newest observation is the
   * one a later revoke has to reason from. `target` is which admin surface the
   * privilege is for, stored rather than inferred from the object name so a
   * later reader is not parsing `system.` prefixes to work it out.
