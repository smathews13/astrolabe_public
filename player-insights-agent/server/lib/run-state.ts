 * defect nobody finds by reading a query: it shows up as two executors on one
 * run, or as a run that is answered and then quietly reopened. So it lives
 * here, on its own, where it can be exhaustively tested against its own
 * invariants rather than against whatever paths the ask route happens to take
 * today.
 *
 * The thing this replaces is not another state machine. It is the absence of
 * one: a truncated stream currently causes one blocking retry of the same
 * question, and nothing durable records that the first attempt existed, so the
 * model and its tools can run twice for one question and the second answer wins
 * by arriving second.
