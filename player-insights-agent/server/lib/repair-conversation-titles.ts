/**
 * Restore the conversation labels an earlier version cut to 80 characters.
 *
 * WHY A REPAIR AND NOT JUST A FIX. The label was derived with `prompt.slice(0, 80)`
 * and STORED that way, so fixing the derivation only helps conversations asked
 * afterwards. Every row written before it keeps a fragment as its permanent label —
 * on example, one of four read "Which three titles had the most active players in the
 * last 30 days, and how many", with nothing to say a question mark had been cut off
 * the end of it. The rail has no other source for that text, so without this the
 * only way those rows ever read properly is for somebody to ask them again.
 *
 * The question itself was never lost: it is in `messages` as the turn's content.
 * This reads it back from there.
 *
 * WHY THE DERIVATION IS NOT DONE IN SQL. `conversationTitle` collapses whitespace,
 * cuts on a word boundary and marks that it cut. Expressing that a second time in
 * Postgres would put two versions of one rule in the codebase, which is the exact
 * defect this repair exists to clean up — the 80-character cut was written twice,
 * in the server and in the browser. So the rows come back to Node and the shared
 * function derives the label.
 *
 * WHY IT IS SAFE TO RUN AT EVERY BOOT. A row is only rewritten when its title is
 * PROVABLY a truncation: exactly 80 characters long, and a prefix of the first
 * question in that conversation. A label somebody meant to be 80 characters is
 * indistinguishable from a cut one by length alone, hence the prefix test; and once
 * a row is repaired it no longer matches, so the second boot updates nothing.
