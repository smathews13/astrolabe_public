/**
 * What the app is allowed to say about personal information.
 *
 * ── THE CLAIM THESE TESTS DEFEND ──
 *
 * There is no answer meaning "contains no personal data", and every route to one
 * is closed. That is the whole of it. A detector that guesses from values would
 * be wrong in both directions and, far worse, would be BELIEVED: a green tick
 * from an automated scan reads as a clearance, and the person it most reassures
 * is the one who most needs to be careful.
 *
 * So the assertions below are mostly about what does NOT happen. A refused read
 * does not become "not classified". An empty result from a catalog the reader
 * cannot see into does not become a clean bill. A name that cannot be safely put
 * in a statement is reported rather than skipped. Each of those is a way for a
 * silence to be read as a finding.
 *
 * Every catalog, schema, table and column name here is invented.
