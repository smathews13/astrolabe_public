 *

 * not subtle in hindsight. `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` is
 * refused when the app's Postgres role does not own the table, because
 * ownership is checked BEFORE the statement is found to be a no-op. The whole
 * `player_insights` schema had to be exported, dropped and recreated to get out
 * of it. So the ledger's migrations are constrained in a way that is easy to
 * state and easy to violate accidentally, and the constraints are asserted here
 * rather than left in a comment.
