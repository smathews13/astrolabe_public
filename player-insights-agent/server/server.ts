// The serving() plugin is deliberately NOT registered. Its invoke path runs the
// request body through two allowlists that drop unknown keys (the plugin's own
// schema filter, then the SDK's servingEndpoints.query() field list), and
// custom_inputs survives neither. The insights route talks to the endpoint
// through apiClient.request() instead, which sends the body verbatim. Adding
// serving() back would republish POST /api/serving/invoke and
// /api/serving/:alias/invoke as lossy entry points; server.test.ts fails if it
// reappears.
// The pool numbers are stated rather than inherited, so a connection-starvation
// problem is answerable with an environment variable. Only the fields AppKit
// actually forwards are passed: it rebuilds the pg config from a fixed field
// list, so `statement_timeout` given here would type-check and be discarded.
// That timeout is applied per session by the read funnel instead — see
// lib/lakebase-pool.ts.

    // list to every consumer who asked for it.
    setupAdminRoutes(appkit);
    // After the insights routes for the reason above and for one more: they register
    // the super-admin guard as well, and Express applies middleware to what is added

    // and remove administrators, which is the one thing the rank exists to reserve.
    setupUserRoutes(appkit);
    // After the insights routes for the same reason as the two above: the admin
    // guard is registered in there, and Express applies middleware to what is
    // added afterwards. Registered first, Monitoring would serve every person's
    // questions and answers to any signed-in reader. `setupMonitoringRoutes`
    // checks that the guard's prefix list covers each of its paths and registers
    // nothing if it does not, but that check cannot see this ordering, so this is
    // the half of the protection that lives here.

    // After the insights routes for the same reason again, and worth stating
    // separately rather than folding into the note above: these report what this
    // deployment costs and how much of it people use. Registered first, the bill
    // and the traffic would be readable by any signed-in consumer.
    // `setupOpsRoutes` makes the same coverage check against the guard's prefix
    // list and registers nothing if a path is not covered.
    setupOpsRoutes(appkit, { isAdminRoute });
    // After the insights routes for the identity gate above all: the recorder
    // takes the acting person from the request rather than from the body, so a
    // request that reached it without an established identity would record an
    // export against nobody. `setupEgressRoutes` also checks that the admin guard
    // covers its `/api/egress/admin` paths AND leaves the two open ones alone,
    // and registers nothing if either is wrong.

    // which a `fetch().json()` reports as a parse error rather than as a route
    // that is gone. 410 rather than 404 so a rolling deploy, where a route
    // genuinely is not up yet, stays distinguishable in the logs.
