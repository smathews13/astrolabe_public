/**
 * What the Traffic block says when one of its three reads did not answer.
 *
 * THE FAULT THIS FILE EXISTS FOR. Traffic is three independent reads drawn as
 * three charts. They are settled rather than awaited together, deliberately, so
 * that a deployment without the run ledger still gets its questions chart. But
 * the block only reported a reason when ALL THREE rejected, so one read timing
 * out drew an empty chart under a heading that names a population: a page
 * asserting nobody asked anything, in a deployment where the store simply could
 * not be reached in time. A thirty-second statement limit landed on these reads
 * this week, which turns that from theoretical into the ordinary way a busy
 * deployment fails.
 *
 * Zero and "we could not establish it" have to be different on screen. So:
 *
 *  - Every read answering, with nothing in the range, is a genuine zero and
 *    says nothing extra.
 *  - One or two failing keeps the charts that answered and names the ones that
 *    did not, in `unread`.
 *  - All three failing is still the whole block's failure, in `reason`, which is
 *    the field the page substitutes the block for.
 *
 * `unread` and `reason` are therefore not two spellings of one thing:
 * `reason` REPLACES the charts and `unread` stands beside them.
