/**
 * That the schema pass is not governed by the READ timeout.
 *
 * ── THE FAULT, WHICH TOOK TWO CHANGES LANDING ON THE SAME DAY ──
 *
 * The statement timeout cannot be pool configuration, because AppKit drops it
 * (see the head of `lakebase-pool.ts`), so reads apply it as a SESSION setting
 * on a pooled connection: `SET statement_timeout = 30000`, once per physical
 * connection, remembered so it costs nothing thereafter.
 *
 * A session setting outlives the read that made it. It belongs to the
 * connection, and the pool hands that connection to whoever asks next. Nothing
 * about that mattered while the schema pass ran to completion BEFORE the app
 * served anything: no read had happened, so no connection carried the setting.
 *
 * The same day made startup non-blocking. The schema pass is now fired and not
 * awaited, and `startLakebaseWatchdog` begins probing immediately, so a read
 * lands on the pool while the DDL is still going. From then on `CREATE INDEX`
 * can be issued on a connection some earlier read set a thirty-second limit on.
 *
 * ── WHY THIRTY SECONDS IS NOT OBVIOUSLY ENOUGH FOR A CREATE INDEX ──
 *
 * Not because building the index is slow. `CREATE INDEX` takes an ACCESS
 * EXCLUSIVE lock and WAITS for the reads already touching `messages` to finish,
 * and `statement_timeout` counts that wait. The build and the queue are one
 * budget. A redeploy that adds an index to a table this app is concurrently
 * serving reads from -- which is precisely what non-blocking startup made
 * normal, and what happened on 2026-08-16 with `messages_conversation_created_idx`
 * over 260,000 rows -- can therefore be cancelled without the index ever having
 * been the slow part.
 *
 * What that leaves behind is the bad kind of broken: the statement is reported
 * as FAILED with Postgres's cancellation message, the deployment carries on,
 * and every Monitoring read is quadratic against a store that has no index and
 * no record of why. The log says the statement failed. Nothing says the app set
 * a read's timer on it.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS ASSERTED ──
 *
 * A single connection, reused, exactly as a pool reuses one. The reads set
 * their limit on it and the DDL must not run under that limit -- and, the half
 * a careless fix breaks, the reads after the schema pass must still have it.
