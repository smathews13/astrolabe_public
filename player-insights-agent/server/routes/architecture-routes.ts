/**
 * What the app can say about its own shape without asking anything expensive.
 *
 * THIS ROUTE DELIBERATELY PROBES NOTHING. The Architecture page needs the two
 * payloads the Connections page reads -- `/api/settings` and `/api/preflight` --
 * to say whether a dependency is reachable or drifted, and each of those
 * invokes the serving endpoint. Two endpoint invocations on the first paint of
 * a page somebody opened to look at a diagram is a cold start they did not ask
 * for, so they are behind an explicit control and this route answers the cheap
 * half immediately: what the app itself was given, and where it would send a
 * reader who clicked something.
 *
 * The consequence is stated rather than hidden. Every connection starts as
 * `not checked`, which is a real status in `connection-status.ts` and not a
 * placeholder, and the page says a check has not run rather than implying one
 * passed.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE IS A LITERAL. Host, endpoint name, warehouse id, experiment id
 * and the Lakebase endpoint are read from the app container's environment,
 * which is where `app.yaml` puts them. A value baked into this file would ship
 * one workspace's deployment into every build, and the publication leak check
 * blocks on exactly that.
