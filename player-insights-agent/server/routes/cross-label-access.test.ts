/**
 * One label's reader must not receive another label's data, and a corporate
 * reader must not receive a label-private product they were never granted.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE CAN AND CANNOT ESTABLISH. Whether Unity Catalog actually denies
 * those reads is the platform's half, and it is not knowable from here: it needs
 * a workspace, two real principals and the grants themselves. Asserting it with
 * a fake would be worse than not asserting it, because the file would then read
 * as covering the thing it cannot see.
 *
 * What lives in this repo is the other half, and it is the half that has been
 * wrong: given that the platform denies, does this app STOP. It used to not. It
 * caught the denial, asked again as its own service principal, and returned an
 * answer built from tables the reader had just been refused -- so the product's
 * behaviour on a correctly-configured metastore was to route around it. Every
 * test here drives a denial in and asserts on what came out.
 *
 * The scenarios differ only in who is denied what. That is deliberate: the app
 * cannot tell a cross-label denial from any other, must not try, and the tests
 * say so by treating them identically.
