/**
 * What a reopened conversation is told about who its answers ran as.
 *
 * The ask route records the executing identity in columns on the message row,
 * beside the answer rather than inside it, because who a run executed as is this
 * app's record about the agent and not part of the agent's answer contract. The
 * route that serves a conversation back did not project those columns, so the
 * browser was handed answers with no identity attached and its footer said, of
 * every answer ever given, that the identity was unconfirmed.
 *
 * The projection is the whole of the server's part in that, and it is asserted
 * two ways here: that the columns are in the statement, and that a row holding
 * them survives the trip to the response body. The second is the one that would
 * catch a later change dropping them somewhere between the query and the JSON;
 * the first is the one that names what is missing when it breaks.
