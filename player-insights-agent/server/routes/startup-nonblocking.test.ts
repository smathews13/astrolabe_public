/**
 * That the app answers before it has finished creating its own schema.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A TEST AND NOT A NOTE. AppKit does not begin listening until the
 * `onPluginsReady` callback resolves, so anything awaited on that path is time
 * the container answers nothing at all: not the health check, not readiness, not
 * a redeploy's first request. The schema pass is 20-odd DDL statements against
 * Lakebase and takes 0.5-2s cold, longer on a first deploy.
 *
 * The failure mode is the reason this cannot be left to review. On a laptop the
 * store is warm and local, the pass takes milliseconds, and a boot that blocks on
 * it looks instant. The same code in the workspace holds the port closed long
 * enough for a platform health check to decide the container is not up. So the
 * property is asserted against a schema pass that has not finished AT ALL, which
 * no amount of local speed can fake.
