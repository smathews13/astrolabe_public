/**
 * The signed-in user is the authorization boundary, asserted from outside the
 * app.
 *
 * ONE PROPERTY MATTERS MORE THAN THE REST and most of this file is about it: no
 * analytical request is ever executed under the app's own service principal. The
 * route used to catch a 401 or a 403 from the forwarded token and invoke the
 * endpoint again with no token at all, which the transport resolves as the app.
 * The answer came back, was stored, and carried a caveat, so the product could
 * report that a user's access had been checked while the warehouse had executed
 * for somebody else.
 *
 * The tests are therefore mostly about what did NOT happen: how many times the
 * endpoint was called, what credential each call carried, and whether anything
 * was written. An assertion that a refusal has the right code is worth much less
 * than one that the refusal was the end of it.
 *
 * NOT COVERED HERE, because neither can be established without a live workspace:
 * whether Unity Catalog actually denies one label's reader the other label's
 * tables, and whether Model Serving parks the invoker's downscoped token. Those
 * are properties of the platform's enforcement. What is covered is that when the
 * platform denies, this app stops, which is the half that lives in this repo.
 * The agent's side of the boundary is in agent/tests/test_execution_identity.py.
