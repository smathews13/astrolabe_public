/**
 * What actually failed, said in the provider's own words rather than in ours.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AS A TYPE RATHER THAN A STRING. `UnavailableResult.detail` was
 * already a string, already populated at every failure site, and already on the
 * wire. It reached the browser and was dropped there, because
 * `unavailableNotice` had nowhere to put it, and nobody noticed for months: the
 * server logs held "PERMISSION DENIED on
 * <your_catalog>.<your_schema>.gold_title_daily_summary" while the
 * reader was shown "a service this needed did not respond just now". A single
 * prose field invites exactly that, because prose has no shape a renderer can
 * be required to honour. Named fields can be asserted on, and
 * `unavailable-copy.test.ts` now asserts each of them survives to the rendered
 * notice.
 *
 * THE FIVE THINGS A READER IS OWED, and this is the order they are read in:
 *   1. WHICH dependency failed, by the name it has in the workspace, because
 *      "a service" is not something anybody can go and look at.
 *   2. WHAT it said: status, provider code, provider sentence, unparaphrased.
 *      A paraphrase of an error is a second error to debug.
 *   3. WHERE in the run it stopped, when the trace got that far.
 *   4. WHO it ran as, because a permission failure is unreadable without it.
 *   5. Whether waiting helps, and only when it does.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT ALLOWED TO CARRY. Anything a reader is not cleared to see.
 * Unity Catalog names the table, the privilege and its owner in a denial, which
 * is right for the client holding the credential and wrong for this response
 * body: it reaches the person who has just been told they may not read that
 * table, and another label's restricted product is that label's business. So
 * the AUTHORIZATION path sends `AuthorizationRefused.disclosable` rather than
 * the provider's own sentence, and the operator's copy stays in the log beside
 * the correlation id. Everything else -- an endpoint that did not answer, a
 * deadline, a shape the app cannot read -- describes our own infrastructure and
 * travels verbatim. See the `providerMessage` note below before widening that.

 * The dependencies a run can fail on, named so a heading can be specific.

 * that a reader can act on it, and "the service" typed forty different ways at
 * forty call sites is the state this replaces. `unknown` is a real member: a
 * transport that rejects before it has resolved a host knows something failed
