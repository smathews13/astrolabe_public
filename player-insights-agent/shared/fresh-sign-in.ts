/**
 * The one action that helps a reader whose sign-in is short of a permission.
 *
 * ONE COPY, READ BY TWO SURFACES. The strip above every page states it from the
 * identity report, and the Connections page states it against the individual
 * row that was refused. Those are two places a reader can meet the same fact,
 * and a second wording of it is a second thing to keep true: the version that
 * cost an afternoon told somebody to sign out of Databricks, which does not
 * clear this app's sign-in and never did.
 *
 * Here rather than in either caller because both import it and neither may
 * import the other. `session-freshness.ts` reads `tokenCarriesScope` out of
 * `dependency-probes.ts`, so a remedy living in the first and used by the
 * second would close a cycle between them.
 *
 * THE REMEDY WAS CHOSEN AGAINST WHAT THE PLATFORM PERMITS, not against what
 * would be convenient to write:
 *
 * - There is NO supported way for a Databricks App to end its own sign-in. The
 *   session is held by the authentication proxy in front of the container, in a
 *   cookie the app never sees and cannot expire.
 * - Signing out of the Databricks workspace does not clear it. The app is
 *   served from its own `databricksapps.com` host and keeps its own session
 *   there. This is the step a reader will try first and it will not work.
 * - There is no re-consent to perform. Consent is recorded once and kept, so a
 *   reader sent looking for an approval prompt will not find one.
 *
 * What is left is the browser's own doing, and it works: a private window
 * starts with no stored session, so the proxy runs a fresh sign-in and mints a
 * token carrying the scopes the app declares today.

 * it is NOT their session. Neither half is stated as the cause, because one

 *
 * THE GUIDANCE IS THE ONE SENTENCE THAT STOPS A WRONG ACTION, and it is the

 * a reader reasonably signs out of Databricks first: it is the obvious way to
 * end a session, it is what every other Databricks surface responds to, and it

 * WHAT WAS DROPPED WITH THE PARAGRAPH, so nobody restores it as an oversight.
 * The cookie mechanics, the promise that consent is not asked for twice, the
 * clear-your-cookies alternative to a second window, and the escalation saying

 * restarted. All true. None of them changes what the reader does next: the first
