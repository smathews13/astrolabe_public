/**
 * What one dependency check actually established, in the words for it.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FIXES. Every Unity Catalog table row on the live deployment read
 * Status `Not checked` beside Detail `HTTP 403`, and those two contradict each
 * other on the same line: a check the workspace answered with a refusal was
 * plainly attempted, so "not checked" is false about it. The declared-tables
 * summary strip above the same rows said `12 declared · 12 not checked`, so the
 * contradiction was stated twice and a reader could not tell which half to
 * believe.
 *
 * The status on the wire is not the bug and is not being widened. `unverified`
 * is this codebase's word for "nobody established it either way", and it is
 * correct about all of these: a scope refusal stops before the object, a timeout
 * never gets an answer, and an unasked probe asked nothing. DECISIONS.md D6 and
 * D8 exist because folding any of those into `failed` would print "Blocked" over
 * an object nothing reached. So the three-value status stays, and the WORD a
 * reader sees is derived here, once, from the status plus the one fact the status
 * cannot carry: which of the three ways this check failed to establish anything.
 *
 *   refused         we asked, and the workspace said no
 *   unreachable     we asked, and the call broke before an answer
 *   not checked yet we never asked
 *
 * Those need three different next moves -- a permission, a retry, and a run --
 * which is why they are three words rather than one. This module is the only
 * place that decides them, so a row and the strip counting the rows cannot
 * disagree about one check.
 */

/**
 * Why a check established nothing, set by whatever produced the check.
 *
 * On `PreflightCheck.stopped`, and only meaningful while the status is
 * `unverified`: a check that answered or was refused outright has a verdict of
 * its own and does not need one of these.
