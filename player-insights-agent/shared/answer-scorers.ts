/**
 * The deterministic and operational scorers, over the agent's own answer
 * envelope.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL, GIVEN `agent/eval/scorers.py`. The scorer set was
 * written first as MLflow `@scorer` functions, which is the right home for it:
 * that is what a development run scores with, what a pre-release run scores
 * with, and what production monitoring registers. It is also Python, and the
 * only path in this product that reaches the agent as the signed-in caller is
 * the Benchmark Lab's, which is Node. An offline Python harness cannot take that
 * path -- it has no forwarded user token to take it with -- so a scorer set that
 * existed only in Python could be run only as somebody's laptop credential or
 * not at all, and the numbers it produced would describe neither the product nor
 * a person.
 *
 * So there are two implementations, and pretending otherwise would be worse than
 * saying it. What keeps them honest is `eval-conformance.json`: a set of
 * envelopes with the verdict each scorer must return for each one, read by
 * `answer-scorers.test.ts` here and by `agent/tests/test_eval_scorers.py` there.
 * Neither side owns it. A change to one implementation that the other does not
 * match fails on both sides, naming the scorer and the case.
 *
 * THE INPUT IS THE PYTHON ENVELOPE, NOT THE RUNNER'S `BenchmarkAnswer`. Every
 * function below reads `{type, answer, execution_identity, ...}` exactly as the
 * agent's `custom_outputs` carries it, because that is what makes the fixture
 * shared and the conformance test meaningful. The runner adapts into this shape;
 * see `answerEnvelope` in `server/lib/benchmark-runner.ts`.
 *
 * TWO RULES ABOUT WHAT A SCORER MAY SAY, carried over verbatim from the Python
 * because they are properties of the output rather than of the language:
 *
 *   Rationales are structural. They name fields, counts and column names --
 *   never the question, never a sentence of the answer, never a value from a
 *   row. An evaluation record is an operational record and must not become the
 *   way somebody reconstructs what a customer asked or which player a figure was
 *   about. `answer-scorers.test.ts` sweeps every rationale this module can
 *   produce for the fixtures' own question and answer text and fails on a hit.
 *
 *   Scorers abstain rather than guess. Every one of them can return null, and
 *   several routinely do: a definitional answer has no SQL, a refusal has no
 *   sources, a case with no labelled entity has no recall to measure. An
 *   abstention is excluded from both halves of a rate.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE GATES ANYTHING. These functions return numbers and booleans. No
 * caller in this repository blocks a release, a deployment or a certification on
 * one; that is a recorded scope decision (unified plan, X3), not an unfinished
 * edge.

/**
 * Does the statement the answer published still hold the properties the runtime
 * refused it for not holding?
 *
 * THIS IS A CANARY OVER AN ENFORCED INVARIANT, NOT AN OPINION ABOUT THE SQL, and
 * the difference decides how the number should be read. Every statement that
 * reaches a published answer has ALREADY passed `agent/sql_policy.py`:
 * `validate_sql` for the agent's own SQL, `inspect_generated_sql` for Genie's,
 * and both call the same `refuse_restricted_columns`. A statement that failed
 * was refused and no answer exists to score. So a pass here is expected and
 * means only that the guarantee held; a FAILURE means a statement was published
 * without the check that should have refused it, which is a policy bypass and
 * the thing worth being told about.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY NO LONGER CHECKS, AND WHY IT WAS WRONG TO. The first
 * version of this scorer re-derived the column policy textually: any appearance
 * of a restricted column failed the statement. On the first real run that
 * reported 0.625 and it was false. The policy permits a restricted column inside
 * a COUNTING aggregate -- `count(distinct player_id)` says how many players,
 * never which, and is the entire point of the product -- and permits one that is
 * filtered, joined or grouped on. A regex cannot see any of that, so it failed
 * two statements the runtime had correctly accepted, and the scorecard reported
 * an agent defect that was a scorer defect. A textual re-check of a parsed
 * policy can only ever produce false positives, so it is gone rather than tuned.
 *
 * Qualification is checked only when the run reached no Genie space. `validate_sql`
 * requires catalog.schema.table of the agent's own statements; `inspect_generated_sql`
 * deliberately does not hold Genie to the manifest, so applying that rule to a
 * Genie statement would fail it for a rule it was never held to.
 *
 * The stronger check -- the runtime policy's own verdict, via sqlglot -- runs in
 * `agent/eval/scorers.py`, which is where MLflow evaluation and production
 * monitoring score this. The conformance fixture records where the two differ.
