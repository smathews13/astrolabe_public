/**
 * The held-out evaluation set, and the truth about where its labels came from.
 *
 * READ THIS BEFORE READING A SCORE PRODUCED FROM IT.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS HELD OUT FROM. The six cases in the POC benchmark suite
 * (`server/lib/benchmark-suite.ts`) are the questions this demo is tuned
 * against: the ones a stakeholder is shown, the ones the Benchmark Lab runs, and
 * the ones anybody fixing a defect reaches for first. Every question below is
 * different from all six. That is what "held out" means here and it is the only
 * thing it means -- nothing here is held out from a training set, because
 * nothing in this repository is trained.
 *
 * HOW THE LABELS WERE PRODUCED, AND BY WHOM. They were written by the coding
 * agent that implemented this evaluation lane, on 2026-08-17. NO DOMAIN EXPERT
 * HAS REVIEWED THEM. Nobody who knows this data has confirmed that a correct
 * answer to any question below looks the way its label says it does. That fact
 * is carried into the scorecard as `labelsReviewed: false` and is rendered at
 * the top of the pane rather than in a footnote, because a correctness rate over
 * an unreviewed label set is misleading in proportion to how good it looks.
 *
 * WHERE EACH LABEL CAME FROM, WHICH IS NOT THE SAME QUESTION. `labelSource`
 * below distinguishes a label somebody else can check from one they can only
 * agree or disagree with:
 *
 *   `data-query`      The expectation is settled by running a query. Three
 *                     definitional cases are in this state, and the query that
 *                     settles each is recorded in `verification` so a reviewer
 *                     re-runs it rather than taking this file's word.
 *   `data-and-contract` The entity and route half is settled by a query; the
 *                     conduct half ("states the window it covers") comes from
 *                     the published answer contract, which is a document.
 *   `policy-document` Settled only by reading policy. The three refusal cases
 *                     are here, and they are the labels most in need of review:
 *                     nothing in the data says what the agent ought to decline.
 *
 * NO LABEL NAMES A FIGURE. Not one. The underlying tables are rebuilt
 * periodically, so a labelled number would be wrong by the next rebuild and
 * would fail a correct answer. Labels are about the shape and conduct of an
 * answer: which route it had to take, what it had to attribute, what it had to
 * disclose.
 *
 * NO QUESTION BELOW WAS CAPTURED FROM A REAL SESSION. They were written for this
 * file. That is deliberate: an evaluation set assembled from production traffic
 * would put real questions into a committed artifact, and the guardrail against
 * reconstructing what somebody asked is easier to hold when there is nothing to
 * reconstruct.
 *
 * KEPT IN STEP WITH `agent/eval/dataset.py` BY TEST, NOT BY DISCIPLINE. The same
 * twelve cases exist there for the MLflow harness. `held-out-suite.test.ts`
 * reads that file and fails if a case id, question or expectation differs.
