/**
 * What the deployment says about itself, as the Build and telemetry card reads it.
 *
 * The card used to carry two commit hashes and nothing else, so a reader who
 * wanted to know which host they were on, what compute it runs on, or when it
 * was last released had to leave the app for the workspace UI. Those facts are
 * the app's own record, and this is the shape they arrive in.
 *
 * EVERY FIELD IS ALLOWED TO BE ABSENT, and absence is the normal case rather
 * than an error. The Apps API answers with what a given workspace version knows
 * about; a fact this app cannot get an answer for renders no row at all, which
 * reads as a fact that was not established. The alternative -- a row reading
 * "not reported" for six of nine facts -- is the prose this page had removed.
 *
 * Shared rather than declared twice, because the server assembles it and the
 * client draws it, and a duplicated payload shape in this repository has already
 * let one side add a field the other silently dropped.
