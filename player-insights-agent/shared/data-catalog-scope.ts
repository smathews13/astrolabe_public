/**
 * How a `data_catalogs` / `catalog_denylist` value is read on the Connections

 *
 * WHAT THIS CORRECTS. Both values already ride the settings path as
 * `catalog-allowlist` and `catalog-denylist` rows, but the page printed them as
 * a truncated string (or "5 entries", or "not set"). That hid the one fact a
 * customer needs from `data_catalogs`: whether each entry opened a WHOLE
 * catalog (every non-system schema) or a SINGLE `catalog.schema`. Those are
 * different blast radii. An empty denylist is the default and was reading the
 * same as an unset value, which is wrong.
 *
 * The server still ships a single string on `configured` (comma-joined entries).
 * This module is the shared reading of that string, so the page and its tests
 * cannot invent a second vocabulary for the same two forms.
 *
 * Pure: no React, no DOM. The page decides how to draw; this decides what the
 * values mean.
