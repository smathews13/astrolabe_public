/**
 * The held-out evaluation scorecard: the shape the evaluation writes and the
 * Benchmark Lab reads.
 *
 * WHO WRITES IT, WHICH CHANGED. It was going to be `agent/eval/run_eval.py`.
 * That harness exists and its scorers are the same set, but it reaches the agent
 * in-process with no forwarded user token, and the agent's identity gate
 * correctly refuses every turn that has no caller to attribute -- so the only
 * scorecard it could produce was twelve refusals. The numbers now come from the
 * Benchmark Lab's own run path, which executes as the signed-in caller because
 * that is the one path in this product that has a caller. `producedBy` records
 * which, and a reader should treat `mlflow-harness` as the weaker provenance of
 * the two until a service identity exists that is allowed to hold grants.
 *
 * WHY A COMMITTED ARTIFACT RATHER THAN A ROUTE. The held-out evaluation is an
 * offline job measured in minutes, not something a page can trigger and poll. So
 * the run emits a file, the file is committed, and the pane renders it with the
 * date and the model version it was produced against attached. That makes it a
 * published result rather than a live reading, and the pane has to say so --
 * which is what `ScorecardProvenance` exists to force. A number on this screen
 * with no date beside it would be read as current, and the whole point of the
 * Benchmark Lab is that a figure carries what it is a figure of.
 *
 * NO ANSWER TEXT, NO QUESTION TEXT FROM A REAL SESSION, NO IDENTIFIERS. A
 * per-case entry carries the case id and its scores and nothing else. An
 * evaluation record must not become a way to reconstruct what somebody asked or
 * who a row was about, and the easiest way to hold that line is for the record
 * to have nowhere to put it. The labelled questions themselves live in
 * `agent/eval/dataset.py`, which is authored rather than captured.
