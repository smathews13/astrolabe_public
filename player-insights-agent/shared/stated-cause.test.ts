/**
 * The guard's own tests.
 *
 * THE SENTENCE THIS FILE EXISTS FOR is quoted verbatim below. On 2026-08-16 the
 * Connections page showed a reader HTTP 403 on twenty-odd Unity Catalog rows and
 * explained it in two halves. The first half was earned: it compared the scope
 * Databricks named in its own refusal against the scope claim on the forwarded
 * token, and returned `undetermined` with no remedy where it could not tell. The
 * second half appended a confident sentence about WHY, and four steps built on
 * it. Nothing in the code could know that why. Three of the four steps were
 * already done and verified. The reader did them again.
 *
 * So the check is not "is this sentence true". Nothing in a test can answer that.
 * It is narrower and it is decidable: a diagnosis whose own `cause` field says
 * nothing was determined must not carry prose that says something was, and must
 * not carry a remedy, which is a claim about a cause wearing an imperative.
