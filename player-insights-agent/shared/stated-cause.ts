/**

 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-08-16 the Connections page turned Unity Catalog rows
 * red with HTTP 403 and explained them. The explanation had two halves and only
 * one of them was earned. The first half compared the scope Databricks named in
 * its own refusal against the scope claim on the forwarded token, and returned
 * `undetermined` with no remedy where it could not tell: real work, on real
 * evidence, and the part of that panel worth keeping. The second half appended a
 * confident sentence about WHY the scope was absent, and a four-step remedy
 * built on it. Nothing in the code could know that why. Three of the four steps
 * had already been done and verified. The reader spent an afternoon on them.
 *
 * The defect is not the wrong guess. It is that a guess and a determination
 * reached the screen looking identical, so no reader could tell which they were
 * being given. That is what this module makes hard to repeat: a diagnosis is a
 * value with its evidence attached, and {@link auditDiagnosis} refuses one whose
 * prose claims more than its evidence supports.
 *
 * Pure and dependency-free on purpose. It is audited from the vitest suite,
 * which is what makes it a guard rather than a convention; see
 * `server/lib/diagnosis-audit.test.ts`, which is where a new diagnosis is
 * registered.

   * WITHOUT this sentence, could they waste real time or take a wrong action? A
   * stale sign-in passes it -- the statement says to open a private window, and

   * does not clear this app's session and never has. A sentence saying what kind
   * of object the statement acts on fails it: the statement runs either way.

   * So the shapes that do NOT go here, each of which was in the paragraph:
   * naming the object's taxonomy ("a warehouse is a workspace object"), saying
   * what the check does or does not prove, restating something another row or the
   * statement's own comments already say, or offering a UI path beside a CLI call
   * that already works.

 *     Reload this page to pick up a fresh token. If it persists, sign out of
 *     the workspace and back in, then open the app again.
 *
 * Three actions, in a sequence, presented as a statement to carry out. The
