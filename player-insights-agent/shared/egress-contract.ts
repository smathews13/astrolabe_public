/**
 * Every way data leaves this app, what may be done about each, and the record of
 * it having happened.
 *
 * ── WHY THE REGISTRY IS A CONSTANT AND NOT A DATABASE TABLE ──
 *
 * The set of ways out of an app is a fact about the BUILD, not about the
 * deployment. A row an administrator could add would be a claim that the app
 * watches something it has no code to watch, and a row they could delete would
 * hide a path that still works. So the paths are declared here, in source, and
 * the only thing a deployment stores is whether each is permitted.
 *
 * ── THE FIELD THAT KEEPS THIS HONEST ──
 *
 * {@link EgressPath.enforcement} is the whole reason this file is worth reading.
 * A control panel that lists ten switches and applies two is worse than no panel
 * at all: it reads as coverage, it gets shown to somebody making a decision, and
 * the two it does not apply are the ones they stop worrying about. So every path
 * carries what the app can ACTUALLY do about it, in three values, and the panel
 * renders that word beside every row:
 *
 *   `enforced`      Turning it off removes the affordance. The switch does what
 *                   its label says.
 *   `stored`        The preference is recorded and NOTHING READS IT YET. The
 *                   affordance is still on screen. This is not a bug being
 *                   confessed to, it is a path whose control lives in a file
 *                   another lane owns, and the panel says so rather than
 *                   implying the switch bites.
 *   `uncontrollable` The app cannot stop it and will not pretend to. These paths
 *                   carry NO SWITCH -- an off switch that cannot be honoured is
 *                   the specific lie this field exists to prevent.
 *
 * A path may only move from `stored` to `enforced` in the same change that wires
 * it. Moving the word without wiring it is the one edit to this file that would
 * make the panel dishonest.
 *
 * ── WHAT THE RECORD MAY HOLD ──
 *
 * See {@link EgressEvent}. It says that an export happened, never what was in
 * it. There is no payload field, no value field, no byte count of content, and
 * no filename. An egress log full of the data it is watching is the leak it was
 * built to prevent, and the absence of those fields is the only enforcement of
 * that rule which survives somebody adding a feature in a hurry.
